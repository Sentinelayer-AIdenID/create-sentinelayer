## [0.10.2](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.10.1...v0.10.2) (2026-05-20)


### Bug Fixes

* **scan:** publish the Omar action timeout pin through the generated workflow templates, action lock, and install scripts so new CLI users inherit the fixed async trigger path.
* **tests:** refresh the billing usage fixture timestamp so the release test suite does not age out of the 24-hour usage window.


## [0.10.1](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.10.0...v0.10.1) (2026-05-20)


### Bug Fixes

* **session:** refresh stale local cache before writes ([#483](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/issues/483)) ([4ff291e](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/commit/4ff291ef422f36012cf031b84c22cf9f0aea8e00))

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.9.8...v0.10.0) (2026-05-19)


### Features

* **session:** meter senti proxy usage ([5cbeca0](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/commit/5cbeca0c99f22db796f9534fb782eb5ec1709ca2))

## [0.9.8](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.9.7...v0.9.8) (2026-05-19)


### Bug Fixes

* **auth:** keep an encrypted file fallback for keyring-backed CLI sessions so package updates and headless keyring failures do not silently strand authenticated users.
* **session:** route auth/keyring warnings to stderr and dedupe them per process so `--json` stdout remains a single parseable JSON document.
* **session:** make `session read --remote` require the same active auth surface as write commands, avoiding read-works/write-fails partial availability during keyring failures.


### Release Plumbing

* **release:** publish the CLI auth/keyring reliability hotfix to npm `latest`.

## [0.9.7](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.9.6...v0.9.7) (2026-05-19)


### Features

* **billing:** add PRC-1 session usage metering with a versioned `billing/v1` price book, deterministic ledger entries, redacted usage metadata, and AI review/Omar-priced `session_usage` events ([#477](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/477)).


### Tests

* **evals:** add deterministic eval evidence for the AI review billing telemetry change so eval-impact gates validate the behavior-preserving metering path ([#477](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/477)).


### Release Plumbing

* **release:** publish the PRC-1 billing usage ledger to npm `latest`.

## [0.9.6](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.9.5...v0.9.6) (2026-05-19)


### Features

* **session:** add `sl session checkpoint list`, `create`, and `generate` commands for the existing checkpoint API, including JSON output, explicit `--operation-id` retry keys for generated checkpoints, stable manual checkpoint ids, and local stream hydration after remote checkpoint writes ([#475](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/475)).


### Release Plumbing

* **release:** publish the Senti checkpoint CLI surface to npm `latest`.

## [0.9.5](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.9.4...v0.9.5) (2026-05-19)


### Features

* **session:** add `sl session recap now` with optional remote hydration, deterministic recency ordering, duplicate-safe durable tail append, and separate session-age/window-age summary fields ([#473](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/473)).


### Documentation

* **pricing:** add the CLI pricing tier and free-tier abuse-control addendum for DD packaging, paid audit surfaces, and quota enforcement ([#472](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/472)).


### Release Plumbing

* **release:** publish the REC-2 recap command and pricing addendum to npm `latest`.

## [0.9.4](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.9.3...v0.9.4) (2026-05-19)


### Features

* **session:** include the local Senti task ledger in automatic recaps so polling agents and humans can see active/total task counts, status counts, owners, and recent assignments without rereading the full transcript ([#470](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/470)).


### Documentation

* **session:** add reviewable architecture specs for checkpoint restore/navigation, automatic recap cadence and payloads, and billing-grade token/cost ledgers ([#470](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/470)).


### Release Plumbing

* **release:** publish the Senti L2 recap/spec work to npm `latest`.

## [0.9.3](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.9.2...v0.9.3) (2026-05-18)


### Features

* **session:** inject agent-join coordination rules into Senti context briefings so new agents see catch-up, polling cadence, writing, lock-and-claim, and stop-condition guidance as soon as they join ([#466](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/466)).


### Bug Fixes

* **session:** refresh stale local metadata from the remote session before write commands, allowing valid remote sessions to keep working after the local cache expires while preserving strict local-only expiry guards ([#467](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/467)).
* **session:** stop rewriting omitted/default `sl session say --agent` values from `cli-user` to `human-<auth-user>`, preventing accidental human impersonation while keeping explicit agent ids normalized ([#468](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/468)).


### Release Plumbing

* **release:** publish the Senti coordination and L1 reliability fixes to npm `latest`.

## [0.9.2](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.9.1...v0.9.2) (2026-05-08)


### Bug Fixes

* **session:** fix remote session tail hydration for long Senti rooms. `sl session read --remote` now walks durable `/events` pages, probes `/events/before` for the latest displayed tail, and appends API-sourced events locally with `syncRemote: false` so CLI pollers do not re-post remote messages back to the API.
* **session:** preserve local `post-agent` idempotency behavior while blocking durable API relay loops. Events with only local idempotency metadata still sync; hydrated events carrying API durable markers such as `cursor` or `sequenceId` are treated as remote relays and skipped outbound.


### Release Plumbing

* **release:** publish the session-tail and remote-relay fixes to npm `latest`. The repository had advanced to `0.9.1` while npm `latest` still resolved to `0.9.0`; this patch re-aligns package metadata, release-please manifest state, and the public install path.

## [0.9.1](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.9.0...v0.9.1) (2026-04-29)


### Bug Fixes

Carter audited the senti chat sessions and surfaced four orchestration gaps. Each one is fixed here in a borrow-don't-rebuild way:

* **session:** auto-start the Senti orchestrator daemon on `sl session start`. Previously `startSenti()` was wired in `src/session/daemon.js:1110` but never called from any command, so every fresh session showed `Senti actions: 1` (just the welcome alert). Joiners weren't greeted, recaps never fired, mentions never routed. Now `sl session start` and `sl session ensure` kick the daemon best-effort + non-blocking; if auth or the LLM proxy is unavailable the session still works (Senti just stays quiet) so this never regresses an offline / CI run.
* **session:** parse `@<name>` mentions at append-time and populate `payload.to` + `payload.mentions = { handles, broadcast }` automatically inside `appendToStream`. The existing listener in `src/session/sync.js:eventMatchesAgent` already understood `to / recipient / recipients / targetAgent / targetAgentId` — nothing was setting them. Now `@codex`, `@claude`, `@human-mrrcarter` route correctly; `@all` / `@everyone` / `@here` / `@channel` are extracted as a separate `broadcast` array so the daemon can decide whether to fan out. Pure deterministic parser in `src/session/mentions.js`; idempotent (caller-supplied `to` is respected); 10 unit tests covering Unix/Windows handles, dedup, broadcast separation, email-y false positives.
* **session:** auth-derived default agent id replaces the `cli-user` placeholder. New `defaultAgentId(value, targetPath)` helper in `src/commands/session.js` resolves to `human-<github_username>` (or `human-<email-localpart>`) from the active auth session; falls back to `cli-user` only for genuinely unauthenticated CLI (CI fixtures). Wired into `session join`, `session say`, `session leave`. Eliminates the `cli-user → real-name` double-post pattern Carter saw on the dashboard.

### Notes

These fixes are upstream of the dashboard surface; future sessions auto-derive titles + names + Senti greetings without any flag work. Pre-v0.9.1 sessions that already exist still display their legacy state.

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.8.12...v0.9.0) (2026-04-28)


### Features

* **audit:** add Jules-parity persona tools, harden persona isolation, and emit typed audit lifecycle/reconciliation events ([#428](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/428), [#431](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/431), [#432](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/432)).
* **omargate:** add swarm fanout for OmarGate and audit personas, enforce confidence floors, reuse deterministic OmarGate findings in audit, and attach 11-lens evidence contracts ([#433](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/433), [#434](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/434), [#435](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/435), [#436](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/436), [#438](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/438)).
* **session:** auto-inject coordination etiquette, add stable session ensure/auto-resume behavior, and add `sl session listen` background polling with direct addressed messages ([#439](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/439), [#441](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/441), [#442](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/442)).
* **devtestbot:** add Playwright browser automation base, register the devTestBot swarm persona, and wire investor-DD to engage devTestBot with artifact-backed findings ([#443](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/443), [#444](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/444), [#445](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/445)).
* **dd:** trigger authenticated, idempotent DD report email delivery from `omargate investor-dd --email-on-complete <addr>` after orchestrator completion ([#447](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/447)).


### Bug Fixes

* **session:** replay a bounded startup tail for Senti daemon help/directive watchers so immediate post-start events are not swallowed by watcher cursor initialization ([#446](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/446)).
* **tests:** stabilize post-merge session daemon and scope-engine coverage races found during the DD train ([#440](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/440)).


### Release Plumbing

* **release:** publish the full DD build surface to npm `latest`. The previous `0.8.12` package predates B/C/D/E/F merges, so this release carries swarm fanout, confidence gates, session listener guidance, devTestBot, and DD email-on-complete support.

## [0.8.12](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.8.11...v0.8.12) (2026-04-28)


### Bug Fixes

* **session:** auto-derive title from codebase + date and stop test-fixture leaks — the dashboard had filled with hundreds of `<null>`-titled "session" rows because every CLI invocation minted a fresh anonymous room and tests on developer machines silently posted to prod via the user's stored auth. Three changes:
  - `deriveSessionTitle(targetPath)` returns a stable `<basename>-<YYYY-MM-DD>` slug (UTC, sanitized, capped at 60 chars). `sl session start` now defaults the title to that slug when `--title` isn't passed, so fresh rooms are always named.
  - `sl session start` auto-resume now consults BOTH local filesystem state and the remote registry (`listSessionsFromApi`), matching by absolute `codebasePath`. A second machine / fresh checkout / second clone of the same repo now rejoins the open room within the reuse window instead of orphaning a duplicate. `--force-new` opts back into mint-always.
  - New `SENTINELAYER_SKIP_REMOTE_SYNC=1` env guard short-circuits both `syncSessionEventToApi` and `syncSessionAuxPayload` before they reach the user's auth/token. The repo's `npm test` / `npm run verify` scripts wire it in via a `tests/setup-env.mjs` `--import` hook so the test suite never leaks again. Disk-persisted circuit-breaker tests + API contract tests opt the guard off locally to keep their mocked fetch paths under coverage.

### Tests

* Added `tests/unit.session-naming-derive.test.mjs` (7 cases) covering Unix/Windows paths, sanitization, length cap, and the `session-<date>` fallback.

## [0.8.11](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.8.10...v0.8.11) (2026-04-26)


### Bug Fixes

* **session:** emit `agent_leave` on CLI process exit ([#426](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/426)) — CLIs that exit via SIGINT/SIGTERM/crash never sent `agent_leave`, so the dashboard's Agents sidebar showed every prior participant as "active" indefinitely with stale "Last activity: 15h ago" labels. Each registered agent is now tracked in a process-local map; one-time SIGINT/SIGTERM/beforeExit handlers flush leave events for everything this process owns. Explicit `unregisterAgent()` removes from the map so we don't double-emit. Pairs with the dashboard's new 10-min idle-rollover for sessions where this fix can't help retroactively.

## [0.8.10](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.8.9...v0.8.10) (2026-04-25)


### Features

* **session:** auto-resume + `--title` + `slc session continue/set-title/cleanup` ([#423](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/423)) — `slc session start` now reuses the most recent active session for the workspace if one exists in the last hour. Pass `--force-new` for the legacy mint-fresh-uuid behavior. New `--title <name>` labels the session for the web sidebar; `slc session set-title <id> <name>` updates it later; `slc session cleanup --apply` bulk-archives empty stale sessions. Kills the orphan-creation pattern (49→clean).
* **session:** hydrate also pulls agent events ([#424](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/424)) — `slc session sync` and `slc session read --remote` now poll BOTH `/sessions/{id}/human-messages` AND `/sessions/{id}/events` in parallel and merge with cursor-based dedup. Fixes the codex/claude blind spot where agents in different workspaces couldn't see each other's posts ("Apologies — I missed your 5 updates"). Per-source cursors persisted separately so a stuck read on one source doesn't block the other.

### Notes

* Depends on the API endpoints landed in mrrCarter/sentinelayer-api#467 (now deployed). Older API versions return 404 on the new routes; CLI degrades gracefully via partial-success path.

## [0.8.9](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.8.8...v0.8.9) (2026-04-25)


### Features

* **senti:** Senti orchestrator auto-names anonymous participants ([#418](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/418)) — `registerAgent` now hands empty / `cli-user` registrations a friendly sequential id like `claude-1` / `codex-2` / `guest-3` based on the model family, and emits an `agent_identified` welcome event in the stream so participants see the auto-naming step + how to override. Strict guard `shouldAutoRenameInRegistry` only fires on empty caller id OR literal `cli-user` — caller-supplied real ids like `agent-alpha` and `codex-task-holder-1` round-trip verbatim.
* **session:** live LLM-interaction usage events ([#421](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/421)) — new `emitLLMInteraction()` writes a `session_usage` event with both flat fields (totalTokens / costUsd / durationMs / response.text) and a mirrored `payload.usage` block, so transcript download + telemetry sync pick it up automatically. New `aggregateSessionUsage()` helper produces per-agent + global tallies for live counters.

## [0.8.8](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.8.7...v0.8.8) (2026-04-25)


### Features

* **session:** `slc session download <sessionId>` exports any session as an iMessage-style Markdown transcript ([#419](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/419)) — deterministic timestamps, per-agent active duration, persona/orchestrator/family avatars (Senti = shield, Claude = purple, Codex/GPT = green, Gemini = cyan, Grok = black), GitHub/Google photo for the human user when an auth session is active. Senti orchestrator events sign with the Kai Chen avatar + timestamp. Tested up to 20 distinct speakers. Flags: `--out`, `--no-system-events`, `--remote`, `--json`.
* **session:** `slc session list --remote` queries the SentinelLayer API ([#417](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/417)) and the sync command now probes membership when a session id returns no events, so users can tell "you aren't a member" from "session id wrong" instead of getting a silent ok=true relayed=0 cursor=null.

## [0.8.7](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.8.6...v0.8.7) (2026-04-25)


### Features

* **session:** `slc session read --live` wires the SSE + fs.watch composed source from #413 into a CLI command ([#415](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/415)). Source-tagged inline (`[fs]` / `[sse]`), id-deduped, SIGINT-aware. Replaces the old `--follow` polling for active sessions.

## [0.8.6](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.8.5...v0.8.6) (2026-04-25)


### Features

* **session:** SSE + fs.watch composed live-event source ([#413](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/413)) — same-machine peers see each other's writes through fs.watch instantly; remote peers receive via SSE the moment the API persists. Single async iterator, dedups by event id.
* **session:** one-line message preview per row in `slc session history` ([#412](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/412)) — ChatGPT-style left-rail snippets.


### Release Plumbing

* **release:** publish straight to `latest` via OIDC trusted publisher when `canary=false` (default) ([#411](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/411)) — unblocks `latest` dist-tag promotion without needing a classic NPM_TOKEN secret. Canary path still available with `workflow_dispatch -f canary=true`.

## [0.8.5](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.8.4...v0.8.5) (2026-04-25)


### Features

* **session:** on-demand remote hydrate via `slc session sync <id>` and `slc session read --remote` ([#407](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/407)) — closes the propagation gap where web-posted human messages weren't reaching the local NDJSON unless the background daemon was running.
* **session:** past-conversation listing via `slc session list --include-archived` and `slc session history` ([#408](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/408)) — adds a ChatGPT-style local history surface with explicit `archiveStatus`.
* **session:** full-bundle export via `slc session export <id>` (json or ndjson, optional `--out`) ([#409](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/409)) — compliance / context-handoff in one command.


### Documentation

* **enterprise audit:** new `docs/CLI_ENTERPRISE_AUDIT.md` ranks 12 confirmed gaps + a standalone-product readiness checklist for the next 8 PRs.

## [0.8.4](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.8.3...v0.8.4) (2026-04-24)


### Release Plumbing

* **release:** fresh publish so the Promote Latest job (fixed in [#405](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/405) — added checkout before setup-node) can finally flip `latest` to the investor-DD build. No functional change from 0.8.3.

## [0.8.3](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.8.2...v0.8.3) (2026-04-24)


### Release Plumbing

* **release:** fresh publish through the patched workflow ([#403](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/403) added dist-tag verification retry-with-backoff) so the canary → promote pipeline finally flips `latest` to the investor-DD build. No functional change from 0.8.2.

## [0.8.2](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.8.1...v0.8.2) (2026-04-24)


### Release Plumbing

* **release:** version bump to promote the investor-DD build to the `latest` dist-tag on npm. No functional change from 0.8.1 — the 0.8.1 publish succeeded to `next` but a post-publish registry-replication false-negative caused the idempotent re-run to skip `Promote Latest`. This patch bump carries a fresh publish so `latest` points at the investor-DD build (PRs [#388](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/388)-[#398](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/398) + [#400](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/400)).

## [0.8.1](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.8.0...v0.8.1) (2026-04-18)


### Bug Fixes

## [0.6.1](https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1) (2026-04-16)


### Bug Fixes
