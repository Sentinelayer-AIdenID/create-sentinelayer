# sentinelayer-cli

`npx sentinelayer-cli@latest <project-name>`

Scaffolds Sentinelayer spec/prompt/guide artifacts and bootstraps `SENTINELAYER_TOKEN` without manual copy/paste, with optional `BYOK` mode.

CLI binaries:

- `sentinelayer-cli` (primary)
- `create-sentinelayer` (compatibility alias)
- `sentinel` (legacy alias)
- `sl` (short alias)

## What it does

- runs an interactive project interview
- opens browser auth at Sentinelayer `/cli-auth`
- receives approved auth session in terminal
- supports explicit `BYOK` mode (skip Sentinelayer browser auth/token bootstrap)
- optionally opens GitHub auth (`gh auth login -w`) and lets you arrow-select a repo
- optionally clones the selected repo into the current folder for in-place feature work
- generates `spec + build guide + execution prompt + omar workflow + todo + handoff prompt`
- issues bootstrap `SENTINELAYER_TOKEN` when managed auth mode is used
- writes token to local `.env` when managed auth mode is used
- optionally injects token to GitHub Actions secret via `gh secret set` in managed auth mode
- ensures target workspace is a git repo (`git init` + `origin` when needed)

## Current Production Bundle

Initial production scope is intentionally narrow and hardened:

- Omar baseline gate workflows and deterministic local gate checks
- Jules Tanaka deep frontend audits (`sl audit frontend --stream`)
- Reproducible review/audit artifacts and runtime telemetry

Primary commands in this shipping lane:

```bash
sl auth login --api-url https://api.sentinelayer.com
sl scan init --path . --non-interactive
sl omargate deep --path .
sl audit frontend --path ./my-react-app --stream
sl review --diff
sl watch run-events --run-id <run-id>
```

Windows PowerShell note: `sl` is a built-in alias for `Set-Location`. Use `sentinelayer-cli` (or short alias `slc`) instead.

### Human sign-in and agent identity

`sl auth login --skip-browser-open` prints the approval URL before waiting;
in JSON mode the URL goes to stderr. A server outage during `auth status` is
unavailable validation, not logout. Do not delete credential encryption keys
or log out to repair a keyring/file-permission error.

An admitted agent receives its own AIdenID email, Ed25519-backed passport and
room-scoped credential after human approval. Its email and cryptographic
identity remain visible on reconnect; email alone never grants access.
An interrupted claim or missing credential can be recovered with the retained
agent key. For a stale active credential, repeat the original join with
`--recover-admission`, the same `--goal`, `--scope` and `--ttl`.
Recovery requires API support, preserves the original expiry, and cannot revive
revoked, stopped or expired permissions. It is not TTL renewal.

## MCP Live Entry Points And Incident Response

Live MCP entry points:

- Local stdio server: `sl mcp server run --path .`
- Hosted token mint: `sl mcp token mint --scope "sessions:read" --ttl-seconds 300 --json`
- Hosted MCP paste URL: `https://api.sentinelayer.com/mcp`
- Hosted resource smoke: `sl mcp smoke --session <senti-session-id> --json`
- CLI bridge registry: `sl mcp registry init-cli`; credential-bearing commands are blocked from bridge execution

First-debug path:

1. Run `sl auth status`.
2. For local MCP, run `sl mcp server validate --file .sentinelayer/mcp/server.<id>.json`.
3. For hosted MCP, run `sl mcp doctor`, then `sl mcp smoke --session <senti-session-id> --json`.
4. If a bearer or bridge output is exposed, set `SENTINELAYER_MCP_CLI_BRIDGE_DISABLED=1`, restart the MCP host, revoke the requesting CLI auth session with `sl auth revoke`, and follow [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md#bearer-exposure-response).

Architecture map: local stdio runtime and incident response are in
[docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md); hosted OAuth/session-seat design is in
[docs/mcp-hosted-connector.md](docs/mcp-hosted-connector.md); session
coordination behavior is in [docs/sessions.md](docs/sessions.md).

## 60-second flow

1. Trigger:

```bash
npx sentinelayer-cli@latest my-agent-app
```

2. Interview prompts (project goal, provider, coding agent, auth mode, depth, audience, project type, optional repo connect).
3. If repo connect is enabled:
   - choose repo source: current repo, GitHub picker, or manual `owner/repo`
   - optional browser GitHub authorization
   - optional clone into local workspace for existing-codebase feature work
4. Browser auth opens automatically in managed auth mode.
5. Token + artifacts are generated.
6. CLI prints handoff and next command:

```bash
npm run sentinel:start
```

## Non-interactive mode (CI/E2E)

Use non-interactive mode to run full scaffolding in automation:

```bash
SENTINELAYER_CLI_INTERVIEW_JSON='{"projectName":"demo-app","projectDescription":"Build an autonomous secure code review orchestrator.","aiProvider":"openai","codingAgent":"codex","authMode":"sentinelayer","generationMode":"detailed","audienceLevel":"developer","projectType":"greenfield","techStack":["TypeScript","Node.js"],"features":["auth","scan"],"connectRepo":false,"injectSecret":false}' \
npx sentinelayer-cli@latest demo-app --non-interactive --skip-browser-open
```

Inputs for non-interactive mode:

- `SENTINELAYER_CLI_INTERVIEW_JSON` (JSON string)
- interview JSON supports `authMode: "sentinelayer" | "byok"` (default: `sentinelayer`)
- or `--interview-file <path-to-json>`
- `--non-interactive` is required to disable prompts
- `--skip-browser-open` avoids launching local browser in headless runs
- `--help` / `-h` prints CLI usage
- `--version` / `-v` prints CLI version
- `SENTINELAYER_GITHUB_CLONE_BASE_URL` overrides clone base (default `https://github.com`)

## Generated files

- `docs/spec.md`
- `docs/build-guide.md`
- `prompts/execution-prompt.md`
- `.github/workflows/omar-gate.yml`
- `tasks/todo.md`
- `AGENT_HANDOFF_PROMPT.md` (read order + Omar loop + local command matrix + workflow tuning options)
- coding-agent config file for selected agent when supported (examples: `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- `package.json` (adds `sentinel:start`, `sentinel:omargate`, `sentinel:omargate:json`, `sentinel:audit`, `sentinel:audit:json`, `sentinel:persona:*`, `sentinel:apply` when missing)
- `.env` with `SENTINELAYER_TOKEN` (or API-provided secret name) in managed auth mode

## Multi-Agent Session Workflow

Create a managed session (the golden path — one command):

```bash
sl session start --title "my room" --force-new
```

`session start` resumes this workspace's most recent active session when it was
active within the last hour (`--force-new` always mints a fresh one) and spawns
the **detached Senti daemon** that manages the room — agent greetings, mention
routing, recaps, durable checkpoints — surviving your terminal. `--no-daemon`
opts out; `sl session daemon <id>` runs the manager in the foreground. One
daemon per session is enforced via `senti-daemon.json` in the session directory
(logs in `senti-daemon.log` next to it), and the daemon exits on its own when
the session expires.

Startup uses optional cached `.sentinelayer/CODEBASE_INGEST.json` context only;
it does not recursively scan your working directory. A missing, invalid, oversized
or slow cache yields empty context. Run `sl ingest map --path .` separately
when you need a full scan. The cache reader has a 750ms budget and is terminated
before returning; resume probes have a 2s deadline per attempt (one retry), while
the existing workspace-list lookup keeps its 5s deadline. Optional title,
metadata and welcome synchronization are bounded; startup does not rotate auth
or wait through a title `Retry-After` retry. No hard wall-clock guarantee applies
to required local filesystem writes or a stalled OS filesystem.

With `--json`, stdout remains one JSON document. `remoteSync.status` reports
`synced` only after metadata acknowledgement, otherwise `degraded` (or the
existing `disabled`/`auth_required` states). `firstMessage.posted` retains its
**local stream durability** meaning; `firstMessage.remoteSynced` and
`firstMessage.remoteSync` separately report API acknowledgement/failure. An
acknowledgement is not a browser or teammate-access test. A transient resume
timeout keeps the existing local ID rather than minting a duplicate.

Then point your agents at it:

```bash
sl session join <session-id> --agent <agent-name>
sl session action <session-id> working_on --target-sequence <n>
```

For a room that requires agent admission, the agent declares its goal, requested
actions, and TTL. The CLI creates an agent-held Ed25519 identity and waits for a
human decision. When the API reports identity readiness on the approved
admission, the CLI also waits for the minted AIdenID email and verified signed
purpose receipt before it claims; when the API does not report it, the approved
grant is claimed directly. The claim uses proof of possession, then the agent
joins. The private key and scoped credential are stored locally and are never
printed:

```bash
# Agent: request and wait for the owner's decision (maximum grant TTL is 24h).
sl session join <session-id> --agent review-agent \
  --goal "Review the release and report findings" \
  --scope session.read,session.post --ttl 24h

# Or request without waiting, for an asynchronous handoff.
sl session access request <session-id> --agent review-agent \
  --goal "Review the release and report findings" \
  --scope session.read,session.post --ttl 24h --json

# Owner/admin: inspect the untrusted goal claim, then approve, narrow, or deny.
sl session access mode <session-id> required
sl session access list <session-id> --status pending
sl session access approve <session-id> <admission-id> \
  --scope session.read,session.post --ttl 24h
# sl session access deny <session-id> <admission-id> --note "reason"
# sl session access revoke <session-id> <admission-id> --reason "work complete"
```

`session access list --json` reports the `email`, `purpose`, and Jev status the
API returns; the CLI does not invent successful issuance. On an API that gates
the claim on identity evidence, approval queues the AIdenID email and
purpose-receipt work and the claim challenge is withheld until both are ready.
On an API that does not, approval issues the claim challenge directly.
The agent must re-run `session join` with the same goal, scope, and TTL after an
asynchronous request so it can claim and verify its live session-bound receipt.
A room's admission mode is whatever the API stored for it; `session access list`
shows it, and an owner changes it with `session access mode <session-id>
required` (or `legacy`).

The owner actions (`approve`, `deny`, `revoke`, `mode`) run on the owner's own
session. They are unavailable in an agent context, meaning `SENTINELAYER_AGENT_ID`
is set or agent admission credentials are stored on the machine; owners use the
web dashboard from such machines. `session access` commands are not callable
through the MCP CLI bridge.

Sentinelayer includes a deterministic session coordination surface for multi-agent coding loops:

- session event stream and replay (`start`, `join`, `say`, `read`, `status`, `leave`, `list`, `kill`)
- low-noise message actions (`react ack|like|dislike|unlike|undislike`, `action working_on|disregard`, `reply`/`comment`, `actions`) plus one monotonic per-agent read cursor advanced by remote reads; there is no standalone `session view` command
- shared ticket backlog (`ticket list --available`, `claim`, `renew`, `release`, `submit`, `events`); submission hands work to review, not completion
- durable handoffs (`checkpoint list|show|create|generate`), provenance-backed retrieval (`recall`), JSON/NDJSON exports (`export`) and Markdown transcripts (`download`)
- agent lifecycle controls (join/ephemeral TTL presence/leave/kill); listener liveness never enters the durable transcript
- recap and context briefing for late-joining agents
- analytics + lineage artifacts at session closeout

## Advanced options

When `Advanced options?` is enabled:

- `Auth mode` (`sentinelayer` or `byok`)
- `Connect a GitHub repo and inject Actions secret?`
- `How should we choose the repo?` (current / GitHub picker / manual)
- GitHub picker reads all accessible repos via paginated `gh api`
- `Clone this repo locally and build directly into it now?`
- `Inject SENTINELAYER_TOKEN into GitHub Actions secrets now?` (managed auth mode only)
- Final review step lets you proceed, restart interview, or cancel cleanly

The CLI validates repo format and secret-name format before injection.

## Existing codebase mode

When `Clone this repo locally and build directly into it now?` is enabled:

- the CLI clones `<owner>/<repo>` into `./<repo-name>` unless current folder already matches that repo
- it writes generated docs/prompts/tasks/workflow into that cloned repo
- it extracts a deterministic repo summary and includes it in generation context
- if the repo is empty, scaffolding still proceeds deterministically
- if the target folder already contains a different non-empty repo, CLI fails fast with a clear error
- if the target folder is a git repo without a detectable GitHub `origin`, CLI refuses to continue

## Token handling model

- browser auth JWT is used in-memory only
- in managed auth mode, CLI stores only bootstrap token in `.env`
- in managed auth mode, GitHub secret injection uses stdin (`gh secret set ...`) and never writes token to command history
- in managed auth mode, secret injection is verified with `gh secret list --repo <owner/repo>`
- API fallback secret name is pinned to `SENTINELAYER_TOKEN` if server response is invalid
- in BYOK mode, no Sentinelayer token is created or injected

## Persistent CLI auth sessions (Phase 4 foundation slice)

For long-running agent/operator workflows, the CLI now supports persistent auth sessions:

- `sl auth login --api-url https://api.sentinelayer.com --skip-browser-open`
- `sl auth status`
- `sl auth logout`
- `sl auth sessions`
- `sl auth revoke --token-id <token-id>`

On Windows PowerShell, run these as `sentinelayer-cli auth ...` or `slc auth ...`.

Behavior:

- login uses browser approval (`/api/v1/auth/cli/sessions/*`)
- after approval, CLI mints a long-lived API token (`/api/v1/auth/api-tokens`)
- session metadata is stored at `~/.sentinelayer/credentials.json`
- token storage uses OS keyring only when explicitly enabled (`SENTINELAYER_KEYRING_MODE=keyring`) and `keytar` is installed; file fallback is used otherwise
- near-expiry token rotation is automatic on command use for stored sessions
- env/config tokens still take precedence:
  - `SENTINELAYER_TOKEN`
  - `.sentinelayer.yml` `sentinelayerToken`

Opt-in to keyring usage:

- `SENTINELAYER_KEYRING_MODE=keyring` (requires `npm install keytar`)

Opt-out of keyring usage (overrides any opt-in):

- `SENTINELAYER_DISABLE_KEYRING=1`

## Runtime watch streaming (Phase 9 foundation slice)

You can stream runtime run events directly from the CLI:

- `sl watch run-events --run-id <run-id>`
- `sl watch runtime --run-id <run-id>` (alias)
- `sl watch history` (list persisted watch summaries)

Options:

- `--poll-seconds <seconds>` polling interval
- `--max-idle-seconds <seconds>` optional idle timeout
- `--output-dir <path>` artifact root override
- `--json` machine-readable event stream + summary

By default, watch output is persisted to:

- `.sentinelayer/observability/runtime-watch/<run-id>/events-<timestamp>.ndjson`
- `.sentinelayer/observability/runtime-watch/<run-id>/summary-<timestamp>.json`

## Chat command foundation (Phase 2.1 slice)

The CLI now includes a low-latency chat command surface:

- `sl chat ask --prompt "Summarize this diff" --dry-run`
- `sl chat ask --prompt "Explain this failure" --provider openai --model gpt-4o`

Each call appends reproducible transcript entries to:

- `.sentinelayer/chat/sessions/<session-id>.jsonl`

## Deterministic review pipeline (Phase 9.2 foundation slice)

The default `review` command now runs a layered deterministic pipeline:

- `sl review` (full workspace mode)
- `sl review --diff` (staged + unstaged + untracked git changes)
- `sl review --staged` (staged changes only)

Each run writes reproducible artifacts to:

- `.sentinelayer/reviews/<run-id>/REVIEW_DETERMINISTIC.md`
- `.sentinelayer/reviews/<run-id>/REVIEW_DETERMINISTIC.json`
- `.sentinelayer/reviews/<run-id>/checks/*.log` (static check output)

For compatibility, lightweight scan mode remains available:

- `sl review scan --mode full|diff|staged`
- `.sentinelayer/reports/review-scan-<mode>-<timestamp>.md`

## AI review layers (Phase 9.3 slice)

The `review` command can now add budget-governed AI reasoning on top of deterministic findings:

- `sl review --ai --provider openai --model gpt-5.3-codex`
- `sl review --ai --ai-dry-run` (no provider call; deterministic synthetic output)
- `sl review --ai --require-usage-ledger` (fail closed if billing-grade usage cannot be recorded)
- `sl review --ai --max-cost 1.0 --max-tokens 0 --max-runtime-ms 0 --max-tool-calls 0`

AI artifacts are persisted in the same run folder:

- `.sentinelayer/reviews/<run-id>/REVIEW_AI_PROMPT.txt`
- `.sentinelayer/reviews/<run-id>/REVIEW_AI.md`
- `.sentinelayer/reviews/<run-id>/REVIEW_AI.json`

AI usage, cost, and stop-class telemetry are appended to:

- `.sentinelayer/cost-history.json`
- `.sentinelayer/observability/run-events.jsonl`

## Unified review report + HITL (Phase 9.4 slice)

Every `review` run now emits reconciled findings:

- `.sentinelayer/reviews/<run-id>/REVIEW_REPORT.md`
- `.sentinelayer/reviews/<run-id>/REVIEW_REPORT.json`

Capabilities:

- `sl review show [--run-id <id>]`
- `sl review export --format sarif|json|md|github-annotations`
- `sl review accept <finding-id> --run-id <id>`
- `sl review reject <finding-id> --run-id <id>`
- `sl review defer <finding-id> --run-id <id>`

Reconciliation behavior:

- deduplicates deterministic + AI findings by location/message fingerprint
- preserves highest severity finding in each duplicate cluster
- assigns confidence (`100%` deterministic, model-derived for AI)
- persists HITL decisions in `.sentinelayer/reviews/<run-id>/REVIEW_DECISIONS.json`

## Review replay + diff (Phase 9.5 slice)

Reproducibility commands:

- `sl review replay <run-id>`
- `sl review diff <base-run-id> <candidate-run-id>`

Run metadata and comparison artifacts:

- `.sentinelayer/reviews/<run-id>/REVIEW_RUN_CONTEXT.json`
- `.sentinelayer/reviews/<run-id>/REVIEW_COMPARISON_<base>_vs_<candidate>.json`

## Audit orchestrator foundation (Phase 10.1 slice)

The CLI now includes an audit swarm orchestrator with a built-in 13-agent registry:

- `sl audit --dry-run`
- `sl audit --agents security,architecture,testing --max-parallel 3`
- `sl audit registry`
- `sl audit security`
- `sl audit architecture`
- `sl audit testing`
- `sl audit performance`
- `sl audit compliance`
- `sl audit documentation`
- `sl audit package --run-id <id>` (or omit `--run-id` to package latest run)
- `sl audit replay <run-id>`
- `sl audit diff <base-run-id> <candidate-run-id>`
- `sl audit local` (legacy compatibility path for `/audit`)

Artifacts are written to:

- `.sentinelayer/audits/<run-id>/AUDIT_REPORT.md`
- `.sentinelayer/audits/<run-id>/AUDIT_REPORT.json`
- `.sentinelayer/audits/<run-id>/agents/<agent-id>.json`
- `.sentinelayer/audits/<run-id>/agents/SECURITY_AGENT_REPORT.md` (security specialist)
- `.sentinelayer/audits/<run-id>/agents/ARCHITECTURE_AGENT_REPORT.md` (architecture specialist)
- `.sentinelayer/audits/<run-id>/agents/TESTING_AGENT_REPORT.md` (testing specialist)
- `.sentinelayer/audits/<run-id>/agents/PERFORMANCE_AGENT_REPORT.md` (performance specialist)
- `.sentinelayer/audits/<run-id>/agents/COMPLIANCE_AGENT_REPORT.md` (compliance specialist)
- `.sentinelayer/audits/<run-id>/agents/DOCUMENTATION_AGENT_REPORT.md` (documentation specialist)
- `.sentinelayer/audits/<run-id>/DD_PACKAGE_MANIFEST.json`
- `.sentinelayer/audits/<run-id>/DD_FINDINGS_INDEX.json`
- `.sentinelayer/audits/<run-id>/DD_EXEC_SUMMARY.md`
- `.sentinelayer/audits/<run-id>/AUDIT_COMPARISON_<base>_vs_<candidate>.json`

## QA swarm orchestrator factory (Phase 12.1 slice)

The CLI now includes OMAR-led swarm planning commands for governed long-running runs:

- `sl swarm registry`
- `sl swarm plan --path . --scenario error_event_remediation --agents security,testing,reliability --json`

`swarm plan` outputs deterministic orchestration artifacts (assignments, budgets, and phase graph):

- `.sentinelayer/swarms/<run-id>/SWARM_PLAN.json`
- `.sentinelayer/swarms/<run-id>/SWARM_PLAN.md`

Global budgets can be set per run:

- `--max-cost-usd`
- `--max-output-tokens`
- `--max-runtime-ms`
- `--max-tool-calls`
- `--warning-threshold-percent`

## Playwright agent runtime (Phase 12.2 slice)

The swarm runtime loop can now be executed directly from CLI:

- `sl swarm run --path . --agents security,testing --json` (default mock runtime, dry-run)
- `sl swarm run --plan-file .sentinelayer/swarms/<plan-run-id>/SWARM_PLAN.json --engine playwright --execute --start-url https://example.com`

Runtime artifacts are persisted under:

- `.sentinelayer/swarms/<runtime-run-id>/runtime/SWARM_RUNTIME.json`
- `.sentinelayer/swarms/<runtime-run-id>/runtime/SWARM_RUNTIME.md`
- `.sentinelayer/swarms/<runtime-run-id>/runtime/events.ndjson`

Optional Playwright actions can be provided via playbook JSON:

- `--playbook-file <path>` where file contract is `{ "actions": [ ... ] }`

## Scenario DSL (Phase 12.3 slice)

Swarm runtime now supports a deterministic scenario DSL (`.sls`):

- `sl swarm scenario init nightly-smoke --path .`
- `sl swarm scenario validate --file .sentinelayer/scenarios/nightly-smoke.sls`
- `sl swarm run --scenario-file .sentinelayer/scenarios/nightly-smoke.sls --json`

DSL commands:

- `scenario "<id>"`
- `start_url "<url>"`
- `tag "<value>"`
- `action goto "<url>"`
- `action click "<selector>"`
- `action fill "<selector>" "<text>"`
- `action wait <ms>`
- `action screenshot "<relative-path>"`

## Realtime swarm dashboard (Phase 12.4 slice)

The CLI now supports runtime swarm dashboard snapshots and watch streaming:

- `sl swarm dashboard --run-id <runtime-run-id>`
- `sl swarm dashboard --watch --run-id <runtime-run-id> --poll-seconds 2 --max-idle-seconds 20`

Machine-readable output:

- `sl swarm dashboard --json`
- `sl swarm dashboard --watch --json`

Dashboard data includes per-agent status rows, usage counters, stop class, and recent timeline events.

## Swarm execution report (Phase 12.5 slice)

You can package runtime artifacts into a deterministic execution report bundle:

- `sl swarm report --run-id <runtime-run-id>`
- `sl swarm report --json`

Report artifacts:

- `.sentinelayer/swarms/<runtime-run-id>/runtime/SWARM_EXECUTION_REPORT.json`
- `.sentinelayer/swarms/<runtime-run-id>/runtime/SWARM_EXECUTION_REPORT.md`

The report links runtime usage, stop class, per-agent status summary, recent events, and plan/runtime artifact paths.

## Security pen-test mode (Phase 12.6 slice)

The CLI now includes a governed pen-test swarm entrypoint:

- `sl swarm create --scenario pen-test --pen-test-scenario auth-bypass --target https://app.customer.local --target-id <target-id>`
- `sl swarm create --scenario input-validation --target https://app.customer.local --target-id <target-id> --execute`

Built-in pen-test scenarios:

- `auth-bypass`
- `rate-limit-probe`
- `input-validation`
- `privilege-escalation`

Policy enforcement is strict:

- target must exist in local AIdenID target registry and be `VERIFIED`
- target must not be frozen/inactive
- target host must match `--target`
- scenario, methods, and paths must stay within target policy (`allowedScenarios`, `allowedMethods`, `allowedPaths`)

Pen-test artifacts:

- `.sentinelayer/swarms/<pentest-run-id>/pentest/REQUEST_PLAN.json`
- `.sentinelayer/swarms/<pentest-run-id>/pentest/audit.jsonl` (full request/response headers+body)
- `.sentinelayer/swarms/<pentest-run-id>/pentest/PENTEST_REPORT.json`
- `.sentinelayer/swarms/<pentest-run-id>/pentest/PENTEST_REPORT.md`

`PENTEST_REPORT` findings are keyed to OWASP categories and surface `P0-P3` severity summary + blocking status.

## Swarm identity hardening (Phase 12.7 slice)

Identity security controls now include:

- zero-trust swarm identity manifest per run (`IDENTITY_ISOLATION.json`)
- cryptographic audit chain on pen-test request logs (`previousEntryHash` + `entryHash` + `entryHmac`)
- crash-safe cleanup contract artifact (`CLEANUP_CONTRACT.json`) for post-run squash scheduling
- legal-hold guardrails on revoke/revoke-children commands

New identity lifecycle commands:

- `sl ai identity audit --stale --json`
- `sl ai identity legal-hold status <identity-id> --json`
- `sl ai identity kill-all --tags <tag1,tag2> [--execute] --json`

`kill-all --execute` blocks legal-hold identities and marks eligible tagged identities as `SQUASHED` in local registry with campaign metadata.

## Error daemon worker (Phase 13.1 slice)

The CLI now includes an OMAR daemon lane for deterministic error intake and routed queue generation:

- `sl daemon error record --service sentinelayer-api --endpoint /v1/runtime/runs --error-code RUNTIME_TIMEOUT --severity P1 --message "runtime timeout"`
- `sl daemon error worker --max-events 200 --json`
- `sl daemon error queue --json`

Daemon artifacts:

- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/admin-error-stream.ndjson` (append-only intake stream)
- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/queue.json` (deduped routed queue work items)
- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/worker-state.json` (stream cursor + aggregate stats)
- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/intake/intake-*.json` (per-event intake snapshots)
- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/runs/error-daemon-run-*.json` (worker tick execution evidence)

Queue routing behavior:

- events are fingerprinted from service, endpoint, error code, stack fingerprint, and commit sha
- matching open fingerprints are deduped with `occurrenceCount` increments and severity escalation
- worker cursor tracks processed stream offset for deterministic resumability across ticks

## Global assignment ledger (Phase 13.2 slice)

Daemon assignment controls now support explicit claim/heartbeat/release/reassign flow with lease tracking:

- `sl daemon assign claim <work-item-id> --agent maya.markov@sentinelayer.local --lease-ttl-seconds 1800 --stage triage --run-id run_001 --jira-issue-key SL-101`
- `sl daemon assign heartbeat <work-item-id> --agent maya.markov@sentinelayer.local --stage analysis --run-id run_002`
- `sl daemon assign reassign <work-item-id> --from-agent maya.markov@sentinelayer.local --to-agent mark.rao@sentinelayer.local --stage fix`
- `sl daemon assign release <work-item-id> --agent mark.rao@sentinelayer.local --status DONE --reason "fix merged"`
- `sl daemon assign list --status DONE --agent mark.rao@sentinelayer.local --json`

Ledger artifacts:

- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/assignment-ledger.json` (current assignment state)
- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/assignment-events.ndjson` (claim/heartbeat/reassign/release event history)

Tracked assignment fields include:

- `workItemId`
- `assignedAgentIdentity`
- `leasedAt`
- `leaseTtlSeconds`
- `leaseExpiresAt`
- `status`
- `stage`
- `runId`
- `jiraIssueKey`
- `budgetSnapshot`

## Jira lifecycle automation (Phase 13.3 slice)

Daemon Jira lifecycle commands now support ticket create/start/comment/transition traces tied to work items:

- `sl daemon jira open <work-item-id> --issue-key-prefix SL`
- `sl daemon jira start <work-item-id> --plan "1) reproduce 2) patch 3) verify" --actor maya.markov@sentinelayer.local --assignee maya.markov@sentinelayer.local`
- `sl daemon jira comment --work-item-id <work-item-id> --type checkpoint --message "patch applied"`
- `sl daemon jira transition --work-item-id <work-item-id> --to DONE --reason "fix merged"`
- `sl daemon jira list --status DONE --work-item-id <work-item-id> --json`

Lifecycle artifacts:

- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/jira-lifecycle.json` (issue state, comments, transitions)
- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/jira-events.ndjson` (append-only lifecycle event feed)

When an assignment exists for the same work item, Jira issue keys are synced into assignment ledger records for deterministic handoff continuity.

## Runtime budget quarantine (Phase 13.4 slice)

Daemon budget governor commands now enforce hard-limit transitions with quarantine grace and deterministic kill path:

- `sl daemon budget check <work-item-id> --usage-json '{"tokensUsed":150}' --budget-json '{"maxTokens":100,"quarantineGraceSeconds":30}'`
- `sl daemon budget status --work-item-id <work-item-id> --json`

Lifecycle states:

- `WITHIN_BUDGET`
- `WARNING_THRESHOLD`
- `HARD_LIMIT_QUARANTINED`
- `HARD_LIMIT_SQUASHED`

Governor behavior:

- crossing a hard limit transitions the work item into quarantine (`action=QUARANTINE`, queue/assignment status `BLOCKED`)
- if hard-limit usage persists past `quarantineGraceSeconds`, governor triggers deterministic kill (`action=KILL`, queue/assignment status `SQUASHED`)
- warning thresholds (`warningThresholdPercent`) surface near-limit signals without blocking

Budget artifacts:

- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/budget-state.json`
- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/budget-events.ndjson`
- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/budget-runs/budget-check-*.json`

## Operator control plane (Phase 13.5 slice)

Daemon operator control commands now provide unified queue/assignment/jira/budget visibility with explicit stop controls:

- `sl daemon control --json`
- `sl daemon control snapshot --status ASSIGNED,BLOCKED --agent maya.markov@sentinelayer.local --json`
- `sl daemon control stop <work-item-id> --mode QUARANTINE --reason "manual triage hold" --confirm --json`
- `sl daemon control stop <work-item-id> --mode SQUASH --reason "kill switch activated" --confirm --json`

Control-plane snapshot fields include:

- per-work-item budget health color (`GREEN`, `YELLOW`, `RED`)
- session timers (`sessionElapsedSeconds`, `sessionIdleSeconds`)
- assignment + Jira linkage (`assignedAgentIdentity`, `assignmentStatus`, `jiraIssueKey`, `jiraStatus`)
- agent roster aggregates (`activeWorkItemCount`, `blockedCount`, `squashedCount`, longest-session duration)

Operator control artifacts:

- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/operator-control-state.json`
- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/operator-events.ndjson`
- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/operator-snapshots/operator-snapshot-*.json`

## Artifact lineage tree (Phase 13.6 slice)

Daemon lineage commands now index reproducibility links across queue, assignment, Jira, budget, and operator artifacts:

- `sl daemon lineage build --json`
- `sl daemon lineage list --status ASSIGNED,BLOCKED --json`
- `sl daemon lineage show <work-item-id> --json`

Lineage index fields include:

- work-item links (`agentIdentity`, `assignmentStatus`, `loopRunId`, `jiraIssueKey`, `budgetLifecycleState`)
- artifact pointers (queue/ledger/jira/budget/operator state files + per-work-item run artifacts)
- reproducibility run catalogs (`errorDaemonRuns`, `budgetChecks`, `operatorSnapshots`)

Lineage artifacts:

- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/lineage/lineage-index.json`
- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/lineage/lineage-events.ndjson`

## Hybrid mapping overlay (Phase 13.7 slice)

Daemon hybrid mapping commands now combine deterministic signal routing with on-demand import-graph expansion and semantic scoring:

- `sl daemon map scope <work-item-id> --max-files 40 --graph-depth 2 --json`
- `sl daemon map list --work-item-id <work-item-id> --json`
- `sl daemon map show <work-item-id> --json`

Hybrid scope map output includes:

- deterministic seed files from endpoint/error/service token matches
- import-graph overlay (`graphDepth`) from seed files
- semantic scoring from endpoint/signal token matches in file content
- ranked scoped file set with per-file reasons (`deterministic_path_match`, `semantic_content_match`, `import_graph_distance`)

Hybrid mapping artifacts:

- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/mapping/hybrid-map-index.json`
- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/mapping/hybrid-map-events.ndjson`
- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/mapping/runs/hybrid-map-*.json`

## Midnight reliability lane (Phase 13.8 slice)

Daemon reliability commands now support scheduled synthetic checks and maintenance-billboard automation:

- `sl daemon reliability run --region us-east-1 --timezone America/New_York --json`
- `sl daemon reliability run --simulate-failure aidenid_password_reset_flow --json`
- `sl daemon reliability status --json`
- `sl daemon maintenance status|on|off --json`

Lane behavior:

- failures enqueue deterministic daemon error events (`source=reliability_lane`) and execute one worker tick
- failures can auto-enable maintenance billboard for operator/HITL visibility
- passing runs can automatically clear reliability-opened maintenance state
- manual maintenance controls remain available (`maintenance on|off`) with reason/actor audit trail

Reliability artifacts:

- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/reliability/lane-config.json`
- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/reliability/maintenance-billboard.json`
- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/reliability/reliability-events.ndjson`
- `.sentinelayer/observability/error-daemon/reliability/runs/reliability-lane-*.json`

## MCP registry schema foundation (Phase 6 foundation slice)

The CLI now includes deterministic MCP registry commands:

- `sl mcp schema show`
- `sl mcp schema write`
- `sl mcp registry init-aidenid`
- `sl mcp registry init-aidenid-adapter`
- `sl mcp registry init-session`
- `sl mcp registry init-cli`
- `sl mcp registry validate --file <path>`
- `sl mcp registry validate-aidenid-adapter --file <path> [--registry-file <path>]`
- `sl mcp token mint --scope "sessions:read sessions:usage:read" --ttl-seconds 300 --json`
- `sl mcp server init --id <server-id> --registry-file <path>`
- `sl mcp server validate --file <path>`
- `sl mcp server run --path .`
- `sl mcp bridge init-vscode --server-id <server-id> --server-config <path>`

Use `init-aidenid` to scaffold an Anthropic-compatible tool schema wrapper for AIdenID provisioning APIs, then customize transport/auth before runtime wiring.
Use `init-aidenid-adapter` to scaffold a deterministic AIdenID provisioning API contract (tool binding -> HTTP path/method -> response field mapping) and cross-check it against the registry with `validate-aidenid-adapter`.
Use `token mint` to request a short-lived hosted MCP bearer token from the Sentinelayer API. Text output hides the bearer value; `--json` is the explicit operator path that includes `accessToken`. The command is blocked from the generated CLI MCP bridge.
Use `smoke` to verify the hosted MCP resource without printing the bearer. The canonical remote MCP paste URL is `https://api.sentinelayer.com/mcp`; the token audience/resource value is `https://mcp.sentinelayer.com` and is handled by the OAuth/MCP flow. `sl mcp smoke` works today through the CLI direct-mint path; third-party browser connectors such as Claude.ai still require the OAuth browser-flow and connector-registration work to complete before users can authenticate from that product.
Use `init-session` plus `server run` for the local stdio Senti MCP server. It exposes session inbox, durable posts, actions/replies/reactions, API-authoritative file leases, and attention requests to local MCP clients. File-lease lifecycle operations never write session events; install edit preflights with `sl session guard-install` and remove them with `sl session guard-uninstall` before any CLI rollback. Hosted Claude-web/ChatGPT connectors need a separate HTTPS/OAuth service and are not shipped by the local stdio server. See [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md) and [docs/file-leases.md](docs/file-leases.md).
Use `init-cli` to generate a bridge registry for every `sl` leaf command from Commander metadata. This exposes the full CLI surface as `sl.<command.path>` tool schemas, but execution still requires a bridge-capable MCP host with OAuth/session-seat policy and human approval enforcement. The MCP bridge now enforces the human-approval requirement on CLI tools; they are unavailable over MCP until approval is supported. Senti session tools are unaffected. The local stdio server does not list the `sl.*` tools, and a call to one returns a JSON-RPC error (code `-32001`, `data.reason` `human_approval_required`) that says to run the `sl` command in a terminal. A file or directory input to a bridged command must stay inside the workspace (no absolute path, no `..` or symlink out of it). The hosted connector target contract is documented in [docs/mcp-hosted-connector.md](docs/mcp-hosted-connector.md).

MCP operator verification:

1. Local stdio demo: run `sl mcp registry init-session`, then
   `sl mcp server init --id sentinelayer-session --registry-file .sentinelayer/mcp/tool-registry.session-tools.json`,
   then configure the MCP host to execute `sl mcp server run --path .`.
2. Hosted resource smoke: run `sl mcp doctor`, then
   `sl mcp smoke --session <senti-session-id> --json`. The smoke mints the
   short-lived bearer in memory, calls `/mcp`, and prints only redacted proof.
3. Kill switch: set `SENTINELAYER_MCP_CLI_BRIDGE_DISABLED=1` and restart the
   MCP host if a CLI bridge or bearer credential is exposed. In this version the MCP server already refuses every `sl.*` call for human approval, so the switch does not change MCP responses; it is defence in depth for the CLI bridge handler and for approved execution in a future version.

Architecture references: local stdio runtime and incident response live in
[docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md); hosted OAuth/session-seat requirements live in
[docs/mcp-hosted-connector.md](docs/mcp-hosted-connector.md); Senti room
coordination behavior lives in [docs/sessions.md](docs/sessions.md).

Worked MCP examples:

```bash
sl mcp list --json
sl mcp registry init-session --force
sl mcp server init --id sentinelayer-session --registry-file .sentinelayer/mcp/tool-registry.session-tools.json
sl mcp server run --path .
sl mcp registry init-cli --json
```

### MCP Live Entry Point Map

- Local stdio server: `sl mcp server run --path .`, configured from
  `.sentinelayer/mcp/server.<id>.json`.
- Hosted token mint: `sl mcp token mint --scope "sessions:read" --ttl-seconds 300 --json`,
  backed by `POST /api/v1/auth/mcp-token`.
- Hosted MCP paste URL: `https://api.sentinelayer.com/mcp`.
- Hosted resource smoke: `sl mcp smoke --session <senti-session-id> --json`.
- Generated CLI bridge registry: `sl mcp registry init-cli`; secret-bearing
  commands such as `sl mcp token mint` are blocked from bridge execution.

Architecture decisions:

- Local stdio and hosted HTTPS MCP are intentionally separate. Browser-hosted
  clients cannot spawn the local process, so hosted execution must enforce
  OAuth, session-seat binding, and server-side authorization.
- Hosted bearer minting is API-owned. The CLI requests a token with existing
  auth and never signs, verifies, or derives token claims locally.
- The hosted endpoint and token audience are deliberately separate today:
  paste `https://api.sentinelayer.com/mcp` into remote MCP clients; the bearer
  audience/resource is `https://mcp.sentinelayer.com` and must remain strict.
- The generated CLI bridge is fail-closed for credential-bearing commands; use
  direct operator execution for token minting and the documented kill switch for
  containment.

### MCP Incident Response And Kill Switch

If a hosted MCP bearer or bridge command output is exposed:

1. Set `SENTINELAYER_MCP_CLI_BRIDGE_DISABLED=1`.
2. Restart the MCP host process. In this version the MCP server already refuses every `sl.*` call for human approval, so the switch does not change MCP responses; it is defence in depth for the CLI bridge handler and for approved execution in a future version.
3. Run `sentinelayer-cli auth revoke` or revoke the requesting session from the
   dashboard, then re-authenticate with `sentinelayer-cli auth login`.
4. Remove the exposed value from local logs/transcripts where possible.
5. Verify `/mcp` rejects the old bearer after expiry or revocation.

## Plugin governance foundation (Phase 5.2 slice)

The CLI now includes deterministic plugin/template/policy pack governance commands:

- `sl plugin init --id <plugin-id> --pack-type plugin|template_pack|policy_pack|hybrid --stage pre_scan|scan|post_scan|reporting`
- `sl plugin validate --file <manifest.json>`
- `sl plugin list`
- `sl plugin order [--stage <stage>]` (deterministic load-order resolution + cycle detection)

## Policy packs (Phase 5.3 slice)

The CLI now includes policy-pack selection commands:

- `sl policy list`
- `sl policy use strict --scope project`
- `sl policy use compliance-soc2 --scope global`

Built-in packs: `community` (default), `strict`, `compliance-soc2`, `compliance-hipaa`.
Policy selection is stored in config (`defaultPolicyPack`) and applied during `scan init` / `scan validate` / `scan precheck` profile resolution.

## AIdenID CLI surface — Clearance Layer for Agentic Access

AIdenID is the **clearance layer for agentic access** — the site-owned,
per-request decision layer for AI-agent traffic (`allow | throttle |
queue | sandbox | deny | price_required`). The `sl ai` CLI surface in
Sentinelayer drives the **identity-issuance side** of that layer:
scoped agent identities, intent-bound delegation, verification
interception, and lifecycle control. Sites that want to decide per
request consume the identities this CLI provisions.

The CLI includes an `sl ai` surface for AIdenID identity provisioning:

- `sl ai provision-email --json` (dry-run artifact generation)
- `sl ai provision-email --execute --api-key <key> --org-id <id> --project-id <id>` (live API call)
- `sl ai identity list --json` (list locally tracked identities)
- `sl ai identity show <identity-id> --json`
- `sl ai identity revoke <identity-id> --execute --api-key <key> --org-id <id> --project-id <id>`
- `sl ai identity create-child <parent-identity-id> --event-budget 25 --execute --api-key <key> --org-id <id> --project-id <id>`
- `sl ai identity lineage <identity-id> --json`
- `sl ai identity revoke-children <parent-identity-id> --execute --api-key <key> --org-id <id> --project-id <id>`
- `sl ai identity domain create|verify|freeze ...` (domain proof + freeze lifecycle controls)
- `sl ai identity target create|verify|show ...` (managed target policy/proof controls)
- `sl ai identity site create <identity-id> --domain-id <domain-id> --execute ...`
- `sl ai identity site list [--identity-id <identity-id>]`
- `sl ai identity events <identity-id> --json` (list inbound events with cursor/limit support)
- `sl ai identity latest <identity-id> --json` (latest event + extraction metadata)
- `sl ai identity wait-for-otp <identity-id> --min-confidence 0.8 --timeout 60 --json`

Identity lifecycle records are persisted to:

- `.sentinelayer/aidenid/identity-registry.json`

Credential env fallbacks for live execution:

- `AIDENID_API_KEY`
- `AIDENID_ORG_ID`
- `AIDENID_PROJECT_ID`

Extraction responses include deterministic source metadata (`RULES` vs `LLM`) and confidence scores.

## Manual fallback (if auto injection is skipped)

1. Set local token:

```bash
echo "SENTINELAYER_TOKEN=<your-token>" >> .env
```

2. Inject repo secret:

```bash
gh secret set SENTINELAYER_TOKEN --repo <owner/repo>
gh secret list --repo <owner/repo>
```

3. For manual setup details: `https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer#manual-fallback-if-auto-injection-is-skipped`

4. BYOK mode (no Sentinelayer token):
   - keep generated `docs/spec.md`, `docs/build-guide.md`, `prompts/execution-prompt.md`, and `tasks/todo.md`
   - run your coding agent directly with your provider key (`OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY`)
   - generated workflow is a BYOK reminder workflow; wire `SENTINELAYER_TOKEN` later to enable Omar Gate action

## Environment overrides

- `SENTINELAYER_API_URL` (default: `https://api.sentinelayer.com`)
- `SENTINELAYER_WEB_URL` (default: `https://sentinelayer.com`)
- `SENTINELAYER_DISABLE_KEYRING=1` (force file-based credential storage)
- `AIDENID_API_KEY`, `AIDENID_ORG_ID`, `AIDENID_PROJECT_ID` (used by `sl ai provision-email --execute`)

When the CLI sends your SentinelLayer token over HTTP, it sends it only to the API named by `SENTINELAYER_API_URL` (else by `apiUrl` in `~/.sentinelayer/config.yml`, else the default API), or to the pocket gateway named by `SENTI_POCKET_URL`. `POCKET_GATEWAY_URL` is no longer read. The CLI decides this once, when it starts. Custom API origins must be configured: an `--api-url` or `--gateway-url` that names another origin is refused for any request that would carry the token. A project `.sentinelayer.yml` chooses neither the API nor the token: its `apiUrl` and `sentinelayerToken` are not used, nor are its provider keys (`openaiApiKey`, `anthropicApiKey`, `googleApiKey`), which come from the environment or the global config. Watchdog alert channels (`alerts.channels`) also come from the global config only; a channel's `${NAME}` placeholders are filled only from `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` or `SENTINELAYER_ALERT_*` (any other name, or an unset one, refuses the channel), and Slack alerts go only to `https://hooks.slack.com/`. When a project config sets any of these, the CLI prints one notice saying what to set instead. Requests that carry the token do not follow redirects.

The token leaves the CLI in other ways only through operator commands, none of which is available through the MCP bridge: `sl scan setup-secrets` writes it to a GitHub Actions secret with the `gh` CLI (or to the file named by `SENTINELAYER_SECRET_SINK_FILE`, used in tests), and `sl mcp token mint --json` prints a short-lived hosted MCP bearer minted from it. The project token that `sl init` receives for a new scaffold (not your login token) is written to the project's `.env`, its `.sentinelayer/config.json` lockfile and, only when you pass `--inject-secret` (or set `injectSecret` in the interview), a GitHub Actions secret on this directory's own git remote, after `gh` confirms you can write to it. `OPENAI_API_KEY` from your environment is set there only with `--inject-openai-key`. Neither is available through the MCP bridge. Other services' keys (model providers, AIdenID, a memory or embedding service) are sent to their own endpoints.

## Layered config (PR 0.2)

The CLI supports layered config resolution:

- global: `~/.sentinelayer/config.yml`
- project: `.sentinelayer.yml` at repo root
- env overrides: `SENTINELAYER_API_URL`, `SENTINELAYER_WEB_URL`, `SENTINELAYER_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

Commands:

- `sentinelayer-cli config list --scope resolved --json`
- `sentinelayer-cli config get apiUrl --scope resolved`
- `sentinelayer-cli config set defaultModelProvider openai --scope project`
- `sentinelayer-cli config edit --scope project`

## Codebase ingest (PR 1.1 slice)

Run deterministic mapping and emit `CODEBASE_INGEST.json`:

- `sentinelayer-cli ingest map --path .`
- `sentinelayer-cli ingest map --path . --json`
- `sentinelayer-cli ingest map --path . --output-file artifacts/CODEBASE_INGEST.json`

The ingest artifact includes language/LOC breakdown, framework hints, entry points, risk-surface hints, and a bounded file index to support deterministic handoff context.

## Offline spec generation (PR 1.2 slice)

Generate a local `SPEC.md` without calling the API:

- `sentinelayer-cli spec list-templates`
- `sentinelayer-cli spec show-template api-service`
- `sentinelayer-cli spec generate --path . --template api-service --description \"Build secure autonomous review orchestration\"`
- `sentinelayer-cli spec show --path .`
- `sentinelayer-cli spec show --path . --plain`
- `sentinelayer-cli spec regenerate --path . --dry-run --json`
- `sentinelayer-cli spec regenerate --path . --max-diff-lines 120`
- `sentinelayer-cli spec regenerate --path . --dry-run --quiet`

The generator uses deterministic ingest context plus template architecture/security checklists.

## AI-enhanced spec generation (PR 3.3 slice)

Generate a deterministic base spec, then optionally refine it with a provider model:

- `sentinelayer-cli spec generate --path . --template api-service --description "Harden auth and release workflows" --ai`
- `sentinelayer-cli spec generate --path . --ai --provider openai --model gpt-5.3-codex --max-cost 1 --warn-at-percent 80`

`--ai` mode behavior:

- deterministic `SPEC.md` draft is always generated first
- AI refinement prompt includes ingest summary + template context + base markdown
- usage is recorded in `.sentinelayer/cost-history.json`
- telemetry usage/stop events are recorded in `.sentinelayer/observability/run-events.jsonl`
- budget governors apply (`--max-cost`, `--max-tokens`, `--max-runtime-ms`, `--max-tool-calls`, `--max-no-progress`)

## Prompt generation (PR 1.3 slice)

Generate execution prompts directly from `SPEC.md`:

- `sentinelayer-cli prompt generate --path . --agent codex`
- `sentinelayer-cli prompt preview --path . --agent claude --max-lines 40`
- `sentinelayer-cli prompt show --path . --agent codex`
- `sentinelayer-cli prompt show --path . --file docs/PROMPT_codex.md --plain`

Supported targets: `claude`, `cursor`, `copilot`, `codex`, `generic`.

## Omar workflow generation (PR 1.4 slice)

Generate and validate a spec-aligned security workflow:

- `sentinelayer-cli scan init --path . --non-interactive`
- `sentinelayer-cli scan init --path . --has-e2e-tests yes --playwright-mode auto`
- `sentinelayer-cli scan validate --path . --json`

`scan init` writes `.github/workflows/omar-gate.yml` and derives:

- `scan_mode` + `severity_gate` from spec risk profile
- `playwright_mode` from spec signals + optional E2E wizard/flags
- `sbom_mode` from supply-chain/dependency signals in spec
- Action bridge parity: generated `scan_mode` options align to `sentinelayer-v1-action` (`baseline`, `deep`, `audit`, `full-depth`) and use the pinned action ref.

`scan validate` checks workflow drift against the current spec profile and exits non-zero when mismatched.

AI-assisted pre-scan triage (budgeted + telemetry-instrumented):

- `sentinelayer-cli scan precheck --path . --provider openai --model gpt-5.3-codex`
- `sentinelayer-cli scan precheck --path . --max-cost 0.5 --warn-at-percent 80 --json`

`scan precheck` writes an AI report to `.sentinelayer/reports/scan-precheck-*.md` (or configured output root), records usage in `.sentinelayer/cost-history.json`, and emits usage/stop events to `.sentinelayer/observability/run-events.jsonl`.

## Build guide generation (PR 1.5 slice)

Generate phase-by-phase implementation guides from `SPEC.md`:

- `sentinelayer-cli guide generate --path .`
- `sentinelayer-cli guide generate --path . --output-file docs/BUILD_GUIDE.md`
- `sentinelayer-cli guide show --path .`
- `sentinelayer-cli guide show --path . --plain`

Export phases as issue-ready payloads:

- `sentinelayer-cli guide export --path . --format jira`
- `sentinelayer-cli guide export --path . --format linear`
- `sentinelayer-cli guide export --path . --format github-issues`

`guide generate` writes `BUILD_GUIDE.md` with per-phase effort estimates, dependencies, implementation tasks, and acceptance criteria. `guide export` transforms phases into tracker-friendly artifacts.

## Multi-provider AI client contract (PR 3.1 slice)

`src/ai/client.js` now provides a reusable contract for future AI-enabled commands:

- provider support: `openai`, `anthropic`, `google`
- provider auto-detection from `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- model resolution defaults per provider with explicit override support
- retry + exponential backoff on retryable statuses (`429`, `5xx`)
- non-stream and streaming invocation APIs with provider-normalized text output

## Cost tracking and budgets (PR 3.2 slice)

The CLI now includes deterministic cost-ledger commands:

- `sentinelayer-cli cost show --path .`
- `sentinelayer-cli cost record --path . --provider openai --model gpt-5.3-codex --input-tokens 1000 --output-tokens 500`

Ledger path:

- `.sentinelayer/cost-history.json` (or configured output root)

Budget controls in `cost record`:

- `--max-cost <usd>` (default `1`)
- `--max-tokens <count>` (default `0`, disabled)
- `--max-runtime-ms <n>` (default `0`, disabled)
- `--max-tool-calls <n>` (default `0`, disabled)
- `--max-no-progress <count>` diminishing-returns guard (default `3`)
- `--warn-at-percent <n>` near-limit warning threshold (default `80`)

Usage counters tracked per invocation/session:

- `--duration-ms <n>`
- `--tool-calls <n>`

Each `cost record` call now emits observability events to:

- `.sentinelayer/observability/run-events.jsonl`

including normalized usage snapshots and blocking stop-class events when budgets are exceeded.

## Observability telemetry contract (PR 3.5 slice)

The CLI now supports a deterministic run-event ledger and stop-class schema:

- `sentinelayer-cli telemetry show --path .`
- `sentinelayer-cli telemetry record --path . --event-type tool_call --tool-calls 1`
- `sentinelayer-cli telemetry record --path . --event-type run_stop --stop-class MAX_RUNTIME_MS_EXCEEDED --reason-codes MAX_RUNTIME_MS_EXCEEDED --blocking`

Ledger contract:

- file: `.sentinelayer/observability/run-events.jsonl`
- event types: `run_start`, `run_step`, `tool_call`, `usage`, `budget_check`, `run_stop`
- stop classes: `MAX_COST_EXCEEDED`, `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_EXCEEDED`, `DIMINISHING_RETURNS`, `MAX_RUNTIME_MS_EXCEEDED`, `MAX_TOOL_CALLS_EXCEEDED`, `MANUAL_STOP`, `ERROR`, `UNKNOWN`

## Requirements

- Node.js `>=22.19.0` (the package `engines`; Lighthouse 13, used by `devtestbot` and runtime audits, needs it). Node.js 20 reached end of life in April 2026 and is no longer supported
- on Windows the CLI also checks libuv 1.48.0 or later: it looks up the programs it runs (git, gh, python, npm and others) on `PATH` only, and an older runtime cannot do that, so on Windows the CLI exits with an error before running anything under Node.js 20
- network access to Sentinelayer API/web
- optional: GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated for secret injection

## Release to npm

This repo includes `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
Automated version/tag PR flow is handled by `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`.
Primary gate enforcement is Omar-first:
- `.github/workflows/omar-gate.yml` (`Omar Gate`) for AppSec findings and merge thresholds
- `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml` (`Quality Summary`) for deterministic build/test/package checks
- `.github/workflows/attestations.yml` (`Attestation Summary`) for provenance verification

Prerequisites:

- npm package name is available (`sentinelayer-cli`)
- one publish auth path is configured:
  - repository secret `NPM_TOKEN` with publish access, or
  - npm trusted publishing for this repository/tag workflow

Release flow:

1. Merge to `main` and let `Release Please` open/update the release PR.
2. Merge the release PR after Omar, Quality Gates, and Attestation are green.
3. Wait for the main-branch `Release Please` workflow run on that merge commit to complete successfully.
4. From a clean checkout of the release commit, run the guarded release command:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main --tags
   git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
   npm run release:publish -- --tag v0.1.1 --notes-file release-notes.md

5. The guarded command confirms the exact release commit has one successful main `Release Please` run, creates the tag with `git tag -s`, verifies it with `git tag -v`, pushes it, confirms the remote GitHub tag object is annotated and cryptographically verified by an allowlisted signer, then creates the GitHub release with `gh release create --verify-tag`.
6. The tag push triggers `Release`, which re-verifies upstream checks, release artifact attestations, rollback readiness, protected `package-release` approval, and npm trusted publishing OIDC before publishing.

Do not run `gh release create v0.1.1` before pushing the signed tag. GitHub release creation creates a lightweight tag when the tag does not already exist, and the Release workflow intentionally fails closed for lightweight tags. If a remote tag already exists as a lightweight tag, `npm run release:publish` refuses to create the GitHub release.

New signed tags are created at the captured release commit. The helper verifies the exact stored tag object, requires its direct target to be that commit, and pushes the verified object even if a local tag ref changes. Local replacement objects cannot substitute for that verification. The Release workflow requires a true tag-creation event; false or missing event values do not default to approval.

Release publish now enforces tarball checksum-manifest validation and attestation verification bound to `.github/workflows/release.yml` before `npm publish`.

Release guardrails now require successful upstream checks on the target commit:

- `Release Please`
- `Quality Summary`
- `Omar Gate`
- `Attestation Summary`

## Local verification

```bash
npm run verify
```

This runs:

- CLI syntax check
- unit tests for core offline generators/config/cost tracking
- end-to-end automated scaffolding tests (mock API + mock `gh`)
- coverage enforcement (`>=80%` lines/functions/statements, `>=70%` branches for core modules)
- package tarball dry-run

Additional test commands:

- `npm run test:unit`
- `npm run test:e2e`
- `npm run test:coverage`

## Local commands (MVP)

The CLI now supports a command tree, while keeping slash-command compatibility:

- `sentinelayer-cli init <project-name>` runs scaffold/auth generation (legacy top-level invocation still works)
- `sentinelayer-cli omargate deep --path <repo>` runs a local credential/policy scan and writes `.sentinelayer/reports/omargate-deep-*.md` (non-zero exit if P1 findings exist)
- Local `/omargate` is a local preflight engine; GitHub PR gate execution runs through `sentinelayer-v1-action` -> Sentinelayer API (`/api/v1/github-app/trigger` + `/api/v1/github-app/runs/{id}/status`).
- `sentinelayer-cli audit [--agents <ids>] [--max-parallel <n>]` runs orchestrated audit agents and writes `.sentinelayer/audits/<run-id>/AUDIT_REPORT.{md,json}`
- `sentinelayer-cli audit registry` lists built-in/customized audit-agent registry records
- `sentinelayer-cli audit security` runs the security specialist agent and writes a dedicated `SECURITY_AGENT_REPORT.md`
- `sentinelayer-cli audit architecture` runs the architecture specialist agent and writes a dedicated `ARCHITECTURE_AGENT_REPORT.md`
- `sentinelayer-cli audit testing` runs the testing specialist agent and writes a dedicated `TESTING_AGENT_REPORT.md`
- `sentinelayer-cli audit performance` runs the performance specialist agent and writes a dedicated `PERFORMANCE_AGENT_REPORT.md`
- `sentinelayer-cli audit compliance` runs the compliance specialist agent and writes a dedicated `COMPLIANCE_AGENT_REPORT.md`

- `sentinelayer-cli audit package [--run-id <id>]` builds/rebuilds unified DD package artifacts from the requested (or latest) run
- `sentinelayer-cli audit replay <run-id>` reruns the same selected agent set and writes a replay comparison artifact
- `sentinelayer-cli audit diff <base-run-id> <candidate-run-id>` compares two runs and emits reproducibility drift deltas
- `sentinelayer-cli audit local --path <repo>` runs legacy readiness + scan audit and writes `.sentinelayer/reports/audit-*.md`
- `sentinelayer-cli persona orchestrator --mode <builder|reviewer|hardener> --path <repo>` generates mode-specific execution instructions with repo context
- `sentinelayer-cli apply --plan tasks/todo.md --path <repo>` parses plan tasks into deterministic execution order preview
- `sentinelayer-cli auth login|status|logout` manages persistent CLI sessions for long-running automation
- `sentinelayer-cli auth sessions|revoke` supports session inventory and explicit token revocation controls
- `sentinelayer-cli watch run-events --run-id <id>` streams runtime events with local artifact persistence
- `sentinelayer-cli daemon error record|worker|queue` ingests admin errors and routes deterministic daemon queue work items
- `sentinelayer-cli daemon assign claim|heartbeat|release|reassign|list` manages shared daemon assignment leases and lifecycle states
- `sentinelayer-cli daemon jira open|start|comment|transition|list` manages Jira lifecycle evidence tied to daemon work items
- `sentinelayer-cli daemon budget check|status` enforces budget warning/quarantine/kill governance with reproducible artifacts
- `sentinelayer-cli daemon control|snapshot|stop` provides operator roster snapshots and explicit confirmed stop controls
- `sentinelayer-cli daemon lineage build|list|show` indexes reproducible work-item artifact lineage across queue/assignment/jira/budget/operator runs
- `sentinelayer-cli daemon map scope|list|show` builds hybrid deterministic+semantic impact scopes with import-graph overlay for daemon work items
- `sentinelayer-cli daemon reliability run|status` and `daemon maintenance status|on|off` operate the midnight synthetic lane and maintenance billboard lifecycle
- `sentinelayer-cli mcp schema|registry|server|bridge ...` manages MCP registry schema, server configs, and VS Code bridge scaffolds
- `sentinelayer-cli mcp token mint --scope "sessions:read" --ttl-seconds 300 --json` mints a short-lived hosted MCP bearer; text mode hides the secret, and generated CLI bridge execution blocks this command
- `sentinelayer-cli mcp smoke --session <id> --json` verifies hosted `/mcp` tools and optional Senti room reads without printing bearer values
- `sentinelayer-cli plugin init|validate|list|order` manages plugin/template/policy packs and deterministic load-order governance
- `sentinelayer-cli policy list|use <pack-id>` manages active policy pack selection (`community`, `strict`, `compliance-soc2`, `compliance-hipaa`, plugin packs)
- `sentinelayer-cli ai provision-email` scaffolds and optionally executes AIdenID identity provisioning requests
- `sentinelayer-cli ai identity list|show|revoke|create-child|lineage|revoke-children` manages local identity lifecycle and lineage workflows
- `sentinelayer-cli ai identity domain create|verify|freeze` manages domain proof registration and containment controls

- `sentinelayer-cli review show|export|accept|reject|defer ...` manages reconciled unified reports and HITL adjudication
- `sentinelayer-cli review replay|diff ...` runs reproducibility replay and run-to-run drift comparisons
- `sentinelayer-cli review scan --mode full|diff|staged` runs lightweight deterministic scan mode for compatibility
- add `--json` to `omargate`, `audit`, `persona orchestrator`, or `apply` for machine-readable summaries in CI
- add `--output-dir <dir>` to local commands to write reports outside the default `.sentinelayer/reports`

Legacy slash commands are still supported:

- `sentinelayer-cli /omargate deep --path .`
- `sentinel /omargate deep --path .`

Roadmap:

- persona orchestrator command set for specialized review/execution modes

## Troubleshooting

- `Authentication timed out`: rerun and approve browser session faster.
- `GitHub CLI not installed`: install `gh` or run manual fallback.
- `Invalid repo format`: use exact `owner/repo`.
- `Missing token in workflow`: ensure `.github/workflows/omar-gate.yml` maps `sentinelayer_token: ${{ secrets.SENTINELAYER_TOKEN }}`.
- `INVALID_MCP_TOKEN` on hosted MCP: verify the client is calling `https://api.sentinelayer.com/mcp` and using a fresh token whose audience/resource is `https://mcp.sentinelayer.com`; run `sentinelayer-cli mcp smoke --session <id> --json` for redacted proof.
- `Hosted MCP bearer exposed`: set `SENTINELAYER_MCP_CLI_BRIDGE_DISABLED=1`, restart the MCP host, revoke/rotate the requesting CLI auth session with `sentinelayer-cli auth revoke`, and follow [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md#bearer-exposure-response).
