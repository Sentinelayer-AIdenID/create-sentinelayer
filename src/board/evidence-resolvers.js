/**
 * BOARD — resolvers: the code that actually asks whether a ticket's evidence holds.
 *
 * `done-gate.js` decides what an answer MEANS. This decides what the answer IS. The
 * split matters because the gate must stay pure and testable while the lookups are
 * inherently messy — networks time out, repos get renamed, tokens expire.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THAT GOVERNS EVERY RESOLVER HERE:
 *
 *   true   the fact was checked and HOLDS
 *   false  the fact was checked and DOES NOT hold
 *   null   we could not find out
 *
 * `null` is not a failure to be tidied away into `false`. **"I could not reach GitHub"
 * and "the PR is not merged" are different facts, and only one of them is about the
 * work.** Collapsing them means every network blip re-opens finished tickets until
 * nobody trusts the board.
 *
 * THE SUBTLER HALF, and the one this file exists to get right: **absence is not
 * failure.** A check that has not started yet contributes no row and no conclusion.
 * Reading that silence as `false` is the same defect as reading a missing CI row as
 * green, just pointed the other way — and it is the mistake most likely to be made by
 * someone writing these resolvers in a hurry.
 *
 * Every lookup is INJECTED (`run`), so each branch above -- including every failure
 * branch -- is reachable in a test without a network.
 *
 * The repo, PR number, sha, branch and ref come from the ticket file. Each is checked for
 * its role before `run` is called (src/net/gh-api-path.js); a value that does not fit is
 * refused with an Error, which the gate reports as cannot-verify.
