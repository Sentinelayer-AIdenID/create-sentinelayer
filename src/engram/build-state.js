/**
 * ENGRAM — build lifecycle: absent | building | ready.
 *
 * An engram that is auto-built on session load is queryable by definition: something
 * will ask it a question while it is still being written. The dangerous answer is not
 * an error, it is a PLAUSIBLE one — a needle search over a half-ingested document
 * finds the best match among the chunks that happen to exist and returns it with the
 * same confidence it would give a complete index. The caller cannot tell the
 * difference, because a partial index does not look partial from the outside.
 *
 * So readiness is a fact that must be RECORDED, never inferred:
 *
 *   absent    no build has started
 *   building  a build started and has not recorded completion -- REFUSES queries
 *   ready     a build recorded completion, and the counts and digest agree
 *
 * THE CASE THIS IS BUILT AROUND: a build that DIES halfway. Nothing gets to observe
 * the crash, so the state must be wrong-by-default in the safe direction. `begin`
 * writes `building` BEFORE any chunk is written and only `complete` moves it to
 * `ready`, so a killed process leaves `building` on disk forever. That is the
 * intended outcome -- an engram nobody finished must never answer as though someone
 * had. Recovery is to re-run the build, which is safe because ingestion is idempotent.
 *
 * A torn or unparseable state file is treated as `building` for the same reason:
 * every unreadable state resolves to the one that refuses.
