# 2026-10-26 - PR 854 configured artifact write boundary

- [x] Integrate current main without rewriting the reviewed PR history.
- [x] Inventory configured output consumers and propagate a private filesystem capability to every current artifact writer.
- [x] Validate full destinations at mutation time; refuse final-file links and use native no-follow where available.
- [x] Preserve trusted CLI/global paths, safe parent links, output JSON and write options.
- [x] Reproduce original unsafe writers and validate real Linux links and Windows junctions.
- [x] Run native Linux boundary tests, Windows browser capture, existing writer suites and required local gates; retain exact failures rather than claiming green.
- [x] Refresh only the two changed evaluation source bindings and rerun its unchanged cases.
- [ ] Complete baseline classification of unrelated full-suite failures, Warden first review, independent second review and required hosted checks.

Coverage, compatibility, limitations and evidence are recorded in
`tasks/evals/pr-854-output-boundary.md`. No push or merge is authorized by a local
test pass alone.

# 2026-09-28 - Bounded session start (`roadmap/pr-800-session-start-bounded`)

## Plan

- [x] Isolate from the dirty user checkout; reconcile main `899aeb3` with npm 0.41.0 (six startup files identical; registry gitHead absent).
- [x] Reproduce cold-context and post-JSON process stalls using isolated subprocesses and loopback-only HTTP.
- [x] Bound optional context with an owned, terminable read-only worker; cancel full resume requests and dispose acknowledgement bodies.
- [x] Await bounded startup synchronization; preserve JSON, auth, membership, local durability and existing reuse semantics.
- [x] Add regressions for deadlines, true process exit, JSON and denied/failed remote verification.
- [ ] Run proportional required gates; obtain independent exact-head review before any push/release.

## Review

Baseline subprocesses both failed after 4s: slow recursive read emitted no JSON;
HTTP 200 metadata/events with unfinished bodies emitted JSON but did not exit.
Initial fixed runs finish below 800ms; forced cached-read delay terminates around
1.2s, singleton stalls cancel both attempts and retain the existing ID, denied
401/403/404/503 joins make no writes. Full gates and peer review pending.

AI change class D (authenticated transport lifecycle); no prompt/model changes.
Security boundary: bearer auth, server membership and identity-forgery grant
checks remain; no auth bypass, no session creation in live tests, no credentials
in JSON/logs. Synthetic credentials and isolated homes are used for loopback
subprocesses. No package publication or release bypass authorized.

### Gate regression correction

Same-environment A/B proved the Omar diff E2E failure was patch-triggered, not
baseline: quicker context reads exposed parallel persona billing materializers
rewriting the same metadata file (Windows EPERM). Creation now acquires the
existing stream lock, re-reads under lock, and returns existing metadata without
resetting title, TTL, status or other state. No append runs under the creation
lock. Parallel billing, idempotent/expired-room preservation and lock-order
regressions cover the correction; full gate rerun and peer re-review follow.

# 2026-07-29 - Senti Presence/Cursor Noise Cutover (`fix/session-presence-cursor-cutover-20260729`)

## Plan
- [x] Inventory every listener, recap, status, CLI read, and MCP read path that can append or reconstruct non-semantic liveness/read events.
- [x] Replace listener lifecycle event writes with the dedicated fail-closed ephemeral presence contract.
- [x] Replace event-scanned listener rosters with the membership-gated three-state presence contract; unsupported/degraded presence remains unknown and never falls back to transcript heartbeats.
- [x] Collapse automatic and explicit view receipts into one monotonic read-cursor upsert per consumed window.
- [x] Keep join/leave/status/identity, onboarding briefings, and recaps local instead of relaying them into the remote transcript.
- [x] Add bounded jittered polling, exponential transient backoff, and strict `Retry-After` floors.
- [x] Prove listener/read/status/recap paths perform zero durable heartbeat/view appends and do not scan durable liveness events.
- [x] Update CLI/MCP/setup guidance, run focused and full verification, package dry-run, deterministic review, Omar, and audit.
- [x] Commit locally only and hand off exact SHA plus any server-contract gaps.

## Independent Re-review Correction
- [x] Reuse the canonical `isSessionControlEvent` classifier at the outbound append boundary instead of maintaining a narrower second list.
- [x] Add adversarial zero-fetch coverage for every canonical quiet control type, `payload.source=session_listen`, and an unknown future `session_listener_*` lifecycle name.
- [x] Keep explicit identity/liveness/read aliases fail-closed, including `agent_identity` and `agent_left`.
- [x] Update all seven hosted unit failures so transport/circuit positive fixtures use semantic `session_message`, while join/onboarding tests require zero durable `/events` POSTs.
- [x] Make the compatibility JSON field truthful: local agent registration returns `agentJoinRelayed=false`.
- [x] Move the CLI `listener_stop` path to the dedicated ephemeral listener-control endpoint, consume fresh controls outside the event stream, remove the durable exception, and flip its regression to zero-fetch.
- [ ] Deploy and live-verify the matching API listener-control endpoint and poll-response contract.
- [ ] Re-run hosted Quality Gates on the corrected head after the owning agent commits and pushes.

## Review
- Durable append boundary rejects agent join/leave/status/identity/heartbeat, context briefings, recaps, every canonical quiet control event (including `listener_stop`), arbitrary `session_listener_*`, `session_view`/`view`, and `file_lock`/`file_unlock`/expiry before auth or fetch. Listener stops use only `POST /api/v1/sessions/:id/listener-controls/stop`; poll responses return `listenerControls` separately and clients process fresh addressed controls before events or cursor writes. Listener presence uses only membership-gated `GET`/`PUT /api/v1/sessions/:id/presence`; status, listeners, and recap never reconstruct liveness from durable history.
- CLI reads, MCP `poll_inbox`/`read_history`, listener batches, and explicit `view` advance at most one `PUT /api/v1/sessions/:id/read-cursor` for the consumed window. There is no action/event compatibility fallback.
- Regression proof covers three consecutive no-new-event polls at an unchanged transport cursor: zero local cursor persists, zero read-cursor `PUT`s, and `readCursorUpdates=0`. Separate 404/503 presence/read-cursor cases make exactly four operational endpoint calls and zero `/events` or `/actions` fallbacks.
- Polling defaults to 60 seconds, adds 0-20% upward jitter, exponentially backs off transient failures to a 300-second client cap, and honors a longer `Retry-After` as a hard floor. Default transport is pull-only `poll`.
- Focused session/MCP/noise matrix passed. Full `npm run verify` passed on the final diff: static checks (`357` files), docs validation, E2E (`121/121`), unit (`1784/1784`), 91.79% statement/line coverage, and package dry-run (`sentinelayer-cli-0.40.0.tgz`, shasum `88ce81bff6fc515e4314a7d5de42272baf84bc47`).
- `npm audit --audit-level=high` reports one pre-existing dev-only `brace-expansion` advisory through `c8`; `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are unchanged from `origin/main`.
- Final deterministic diff review scanned 25 files with `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `blocking=false` (`review-scan-diff-20260729-072535.md`).
- Final exact-diff deterministic Omar passed with `P0/P1/P2/P3=0`, `blocking=false` (`review-20260729-072537-76c5c5c5`).
- Live Omar scanned the same 24-file diff with `P0=0`, `P1=0`, five non-blocking generic P2s, and no deterministic findings (`omargate-1785309452607-d08af708`). The P2s are contradicted by existing architecture/incident/onboarding sections in `README.md` and `docs/ENGINEERING_ONBOARDING.md`, the 121-case E2E suite (including lifecycle and transient-recovery files), and explicit malformed/duplicate/abort/fault/429 listener tests.
- Repository audit passed (`P1=0`); its two P2 baseline notices cite untouched `tasks/evals/2026-04-17-pr-335-spec-session-integration.md` and `src/scan/generator.js` (`audit-20260729-072544.md`).
- Activation depends on the API implementing the exact fail-closed contracts: membership-gated `GET`/`PUT /sessions/:id/presence` backed by TTL state, monotonic `PUT /sessions/:id/read-cursor` backed by one actor row, and Redis-backed `POST /sessions/:id/listener-controls/stop` plus `listenerControls` in agent-scoped event polls. Until those endpoints deploy, clients report unsupported/degraded and intentionally do not revive durable events/actions.
- Independent correction proof passed: the seven previously failing hosted contract files plus outbound sync coverage passed `95/95`; `npm run check` passed all `357` files; and the complete local unit suite passed `1785/1785`.
- Listener-control cutover proof passed: focused unit/noise coverage `115/115`; focused lifecycle E2E `2/2`; `npm run check` `357` files; full unit `1788/1788`; full E2E `121/121`. Fresh addressed controls run before semantic events and cursor writes, stale controls are ignored, stop-triggered aborts still publish final `stopped` presence, and neither success nor unsupported endpoints fall back to `/events`.
- Cross-repository review corrected the exact API wire contract before commit: the CLI now sends only `targetAgentId` or `broadcast`, supplies a unique `Idempotency-Key`, accepts the API's `listenerControls: {status, items}` envelope, and evaluates numeric `issuedAtMs`. The post-correction focused suite passed `77/77`, static check passed all `357` files, and the complete `npm test` gate passed.
- Local only: no push, deployment, npm publication, or Senti coordination write was performed from this worktree.

# 2026-07-14 - Hosted Action Live-LLM Evidence Contract (`roadmap/pr-0i-action-evidence-contract`)

## Plan
- [x] Audit the current `a496be3` pin, trusted workflow assertions, deterministic provider-outage fallback, and generated/legacy compatibility surface.
- [x] Verify the hardened Action tree at `52fe9cf0d0d4656ce2b6f4af0eb5652fa07b31c5` and enumerate its input, output, pack-integrity, and live-evidence contracts.
- [x] Define the two-stage ownership boundary: Action validates live execution with `severity_gate=none`; the consumer validates artifacts and applies protected P0/P1/P2 policy.
- [x] Define a non-circular bootstrap requiring exact-head live proof, negative fail-closed validator tests, immutable provenance, and peer review.
- [x] Record the stale same-version global CLI incident and require a uniquely versioned post-fix release before package provenance can be merge evidence.
- [x] Audit fork/same-repo workflow authority and require trusted exact-subject promotion instead of deterministic fork greens or same-repo-name trust.
- [x] Audit live environment and secret-name placement; require the complete gate/release credential boundary to move behind protected definitions and reviewed environments.
- [x] Audit generated/legacy interface parity and separate the Action's `pr-diff`/`deep`/`nightly` modes from local CLI persona modes.
- [x] Run docs/static/diff checks and deterministic review gates.
- [ ] Receive exact-diff Claude review before starting dependent 0J implementation.

## Review
- Baseline create-sentinelayer commit `38db9f2` can report a false green because Action `a496be3` exposes no observed live-LLM evidence and the consumer checks requested provider settings plus selected severity counts.
- The existing provider-outage branch can select a deterministic-only run as the authoritative green result. The migration keeps deterministic scans diagnostic but always non-green for a required live gate.
- The current primary call is input-compatible with `52fe9cf`; only fallback-only `artifact_name_suffix` is unsupported. A pin-only edit is insufficient because the consumer must validate seven evidence outputs and the original hash-bound pack/findings artifacts.
- The required `Omar Gate` currently accepts a clean fork deterministic scan as green without live evidence. Same-repo `trusted_context` also does not prove protected workflow code or secret-consuming actor policy.
- Live config does not match the repository's protected-environment narrative: `security-review` is reviewed but unused and empty; `package-release` has no protection rules or environment secrets; gate and release credential names remain repository-level. Values and scopes were not inspected.
- Generated and legacy workflows falsely advertise `baseline`/`audit`/`full-depth` as Action modes; the candidate accepts only `pr-diff`/`deep`/`nightly`. Generated `playwright_mode`, `sbom_mode`, and `wait_for_completion` inputs are also unsupported.
- 0I is docs/spec/eval only. 0J will own all workflow, generator, contract-checker, legacy-template, validator, and regression-test changes after peer review.
- Protected workflow authority, trusted fork promotion, and complete privileged-credential containment are activation-blocking 0K. Reviewed protected publication and unique post-`#778` package provenance are 0L. 0J must not be presented as trustworthy or activated before 0K.
- Verification passed: `npm run verify` (`121/121` E2E, `1763/1763` unit tests, 91.79% statement/line coverage, package shasum `411f34cc407b1d28a594bfd2e8a6a970afb3cc3f`); locked install audit reported zero vulnerabilities.
- Deterministic review passed on the exact five-file diff: `review-scan-diff-20260714-062821.md` (`P1=0`, `P2=0`) and Omar `review-20260714-062826-9ca0e000` (`P0/P1/P2/P3=0`).
- The environment-policy amendment passes docs/static validation and deterministic review. A fresh live Omar run made two token-bearing provider calls and returned two nonblocking documentation P2s: the incident-runbook claim is contradicted by `docs/spec.md`, `README.md`, `docs/mcp.md`, and `docs/MULTI_AGENT_SESSION_SPEC.md`; the endpoint-inventory claim is inapplicable to this CLI gate contract. Deterministic findings remain zero.
- `git diff --check` passed aside from expected Windows LF/CRLF notices.
- Local only, not pushed.

# 2026-07-14 - Omar AI Call Evidence (`roadmap/pr-0h-omargate-call-evidence`)

## Plan
- [x] Reproduce two deep Omar false blocks where successful token-bearing internal calls report zero customer cost.
- [x] Replace the cost-only AI-health predicate with bounded usage, billing-ledger, provider-cost, or legacy priced-call evidence.
- [x] Preserve fail-closed P0/P1 behavior when personas error or any successful persona lacks provider-call evidence.
- [x] Cover single-persona usage, billing-ledger, no-evidence, partial-evidence, and swarm aggregation paths.
- [x] Run full verification, deterministic review/Omar/audit gates, and live dogfood.
- [ ] Receive exact-SHA Claude review before any push.

## Review
- Change class: Class D deterministic review-gate integrity boundary; no prompt, model, provider-routing, or billing-price change.
- Threat: internal or zero-priced managed calls are billed at zero customer cost, so a cost-only health check can fabricate a blocking P1 after the LLM actually ran; removing the guard entirely would restore silent false greens.
- Rollback: revert this isolated branch to restore cost-only health detection. No remote state, price book, credential, or retained review artifact is mutated by the code change.
- Evidence: deep runs `omargate-1784001480577-697c1a65` and `omargate-1784002043271-e66f185b` both returned `status=ok`, token-bearing billing ledgers, and non-zero provider cost while the orchestrator appended the same zero-customer-cost P1.
- Live dogfood: `omargate-1784003567736-48074a17` completed two provider-backed personas with 3,996 ledger tokens, zero orchestrator findings, and no blocking result.
- Status: implementation and local gates complete; exact-SHA peer review pending. Local only, not pushed.

# 2026-07-13 - Hosted MCP Canonical Tool Contract (`roadmap/pr-r1-mcp-tool-contract-20260713`)

## Plan
- [x] Verify the production hosted MCP descriptor and reproduce the CLI smoke failure against its underscore-delimited tool names.
- [x] Lock the scoped smoke, command, test, documentation, and governance files in Senti room `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a`.
- [x] Replace the stale dotted session-read tool name with the canonical `sessions_events_list` contract.
- [x] Add regression coverage that rejects the legacy dotted alias instead of silently calling it.
- [x] Run focused tests, full repository verification, local review, Omar Gate, and audit proof.
- [ ] Open a PR, obtain Senti peer review, and merge only after hosted checks pass.

## Review
- Focused MCP and command-contract proof passed (`24/24`), including an explicit legacy dotted-alias rejection.
- Live production smoke passed with `7` advertised tools and a successful `sessions_events_list` call returning `2` events; token output remained redacted.
- Full `npm run verify` passed: static checks (`354` files), docs validation, E2E (`120/120`), unit coverage, and package dry-run (`sentinelayer-cli-0.39.2.tgz`, shasum `0d47f751d0063ac237bbde888f9d80ee869e3e1d`).
- `npm audit --audit-level=high` reported `0` vulnerabilities; `git diff --check` passed aside from expected Windows line-ending notices.
- Diff review scanned `7` intended files with `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `blocking=false` (`review-scan-diff-20260713-223618.md`).
- Deterministic Omar Gate scanned the same `7` files with `P0=0`, `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `P3=0`, `blocking=false` (`review-20260713-223627-3dadef27`).
- Repository audit passed with no P1 blockers; its two P2 baseline notices cite untouched `tasks/evals/2026-04-17-pr-335-spec-session-integration.md` and `src/scan/generator.js` (`audit-20260713-223638.md`).

# 2026-07-12 - Senti Recap Estimated Usage Fast Path (`codex/senti-recap-estimated-usage-fastpath`)

## Plan
- [x] Keep Senti room `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` connected quietly through `codex-senti-product-0344` and avoid ACK spam.
- [x] Reproduce the post-`#770` hang: `sl session recap now 954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a --remote --json` still produced no stdout/stderr past the guard after v0.39.1.
- [x] Localize the remaining blocker below remote hydration: reading `17,452` local room events took about `291ms`, dedupe took about `377ms`, but `aggregateSessionUsage(... includeEstimatedMessages: true)` did not return because recap estimated every historical agent message through provider tokenizers.
- [x] Patch recap usage aggregation so billing-grade `session_usage` rows remain exact while non-billing estimated agent-message usage uses a fast recap-local heuristic.
- [x] Add focused regression proof that estimated-message token backends are honored and recap totals use the fast estimate path.
- [x] Run full package gates locally.
- [ ] Open a follow-up PR, request Claude/Warden challenge in Senti, and publish only after hosted gates are green.

## Review
- Live patched branch proof: `buildSessionRecap` on room `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` returned in `905ms` after hanging before this patch.
- Live patched CLI proof: `node bin/sl.js session recap now ... --remote --json --max-events 20` returned in `5120ms` with usage totals and workspace-plan text.
- Focused proof: `tests/unit.session-recap.test.mjs` + `tests/unit.session-usage.test.mjs` passed `34/34`.
- Full proof: `npm run test:unit` passed `1758/1758`; `npm run check` passed `354 files`; `git diff --check` passed aside from expected Windows LF/CRLF notices; `npm audit --audit-level=high` reported `0 vulnerabilities`; `npm pack --dry-run --json` produced `sentinelayer-cli-0.39.1.tgz` with shasum `db7c0ac94003af0ae74e0815334adafcb65fb0c2`.
- Deterministic scans: `sl review scan --mode diff` scanned `5` files with `P1=0/P2=0/blocking=false`; `sl /omargate deep --scope-mode diff --no-ai` scanned the same `5` files with `P0=0/P1=0/P2=0/P3=0/blocking=false`.

# 2026-07-12 - A26 Checkpoint Restore Contract (`codex/a26-checkpoint-restore-contract`)

## Plan
- [x] Keep Senti room `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` polled quietly and post only material coordination/proof.
- [x] Confirm #764 is isolated, green, and still held for peer exact-head review.
- [x] Audit the checkpoint/recap/usage specs against current CLI behavior and identify the remaining checkpoint restore gap.
- [x] Add a read-only `sl session checkpoint show <sessionId> <checkpointId>` surface that loads a bounded source-event window around the checkpoint sequence range without mutating session history.
- [x] Add pure checkpoint restore-window helpers and unit coverage for range validation, API request shape, partial-window flags, and checkpoint id lookup.
- [x] Add command-contract coverage for the new CLI surface.
- [x] Run focused tests, static checks, review scan, Omar diff scan, and package dry-run.
- [x] Open PR and request Senti peer review.

- [x] Surface per-agent customer/unpriced/estimated detail in the text summary without changing existing JSON/Markdown contracts.
- [x] Run focused usage-report tests and static checks.
- [x] Run full unit, review scan, Omar Gate, audit, package dry-run, and diff hygiene.

# 2026-07-02 - Hosted MCP Smoke Proof (`codex/mcp-hosted-smoke-20260702`)

## Plan
- [x] Keep Senti room `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` polled quietly and reconcile with verifier/architect lane ownership.
- [x] Confirm lane split: architect owns OAuth browser RFC compliance; warden verifies; this lane owns repeatable hosted MCP resource smoke proof.
- [x] Use a clean `create-sentinelayer` worktree from current `origin/main` and take Senti locks for MCP command/test/docs files.
- [x] Add a redacted `sl mcp smoke` command that mints an in-memory MCP bearer, calls `/mcp` `tools/list`, optionally calls `sessions_events_list`, and never prints the bearer.
- [x] Add focused unit coverage for tool-list success, optional session-read success, failure reporting, and token redaction.
- [x] Update MCP docs with the new smoke workflow.
- [x] Run focused tests/static checks, review scan, Omar diff scan, package smoke, open PR, and request Senti review.

## Review
- Focused syntax proof passed: `node --check src/mcp/smoke.js` and `node --check src/commands/mcp.js`.
- Focused tests passed: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.mcp-smoke.test.mjs tests/unit.commands-contracts.test.mjs` (`22/22`).
- Adjacent MCP proof passed: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.mcp-smoke.test.mjs tests/unit.mcp-token-service.test.mjs tests/unit.mcp-doctor.test.mjs tests/unit.commands-contracts.test.mjs` (`35/35`).
- Static/docs/full-unit proof passed: `npm run check` (`346 files passed`), `npm run docs:build`, and `npm run test:unit` (`1722/1722`).
- Deterministic review gates passed: `sl review scan --path . --mode diff --json` (`P1=0`, `P2=0`, `blocking=false`) and `sl /omargate deep --path . --scope-mode diff --no-ai --json` (`P0=0`, `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `P3=0`, `blocking=false`).
- Package dry-run passed after final edits: `npm pack --dry-run --json` produced `sentinelayer-cli-0.35.3.tgz` with shasum `75687e8745919ba6be4b1a4df30a0b6d08583820`.
- `git diff --check` passed aside from expected Windows LF/CRLF notices.
- Live prod smoke from patched CLI passed: `node bin/sl.js mcp smoke --session 954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a --limit 2 --ttl-seconds 300 --json` returned `ok=true`, `tools_list` `PASS` with 6 tools, and `session_events_list` `PASS` with 2 events. Output contained only redacted token metadata, no bearer.
- Senti verifier review from `claude-warden` requested one no-over-claim docs refinement: make explicit that `sl mcp smoke` works today through direct mint, while browser connectors still require OAuth/browser-flow and connector-registration lanes. Addressed in README and `docs/mcp.md`; follow-up docs/static proof passed: `npm run docs:build`, `npm run check`, and `git diff --check`.

# 2026-07-02 - Senti Search Contract Wording (`codex/session-search-contract-20260702`)

## Plan
- [x] Keep Senti room `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` polled and acknowledge material peer updates while working.
- [x] Verify `sentinelayer-cli@0.35.3` shipped and the local global CLI is updated before starting a follow-up.
- [x] Reproduce the operator confusion: `session search` help claimed search "by text, event type, or agent" even though the command exposes only a free-text query plus pagination flags.
- [x] Verify the current API contract: `/events/search` accepts `q`, `beforeSequence`/`before_sequence`, and `limit`; server-side matching includes payload, event type, agent id, and agent model fields.
- [x] Clarify CLI help and enterprise audit wording so users do not infer unsupported `--agent` or event-type filter flags.
- [x] Pin the command description with a command-contract regression test.
- [x] Run focused command-contract proof, static checks, review scan, and Omar pass-one.
- [ ] Open PR, request Senti peer review, watch hosted gates, merge only when green, then release only if package publication is needed.

## Review
- Focused command-contract proof passed: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.commands-contracts.test.mjs` (`19/19`).
- Static proof passed: `npm run check` (`345 files passed`).
- `git diff --check` passed aside from expected Windows LF/CRLF notices.
- Review scan passed: `.sentinelayer/reports/review-scan-diff-20260702-170540.md`, scoped files `5`, `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `blocking=false`.
- Deterministic Omar pass-one passed: `review-20260702-170616-4185197c`, report `.sentinelayer/reports/omargate-deep-20260702-170617.md`, scoped files `5`, `P0=0`, `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `P3=0`, `blocking=false`.

# 2026-07-02 - Senti Recap Copy Separation (`codex/recap-task-plan-copy-20260702`)

## Plan
- [x] Keep Senti room `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` polled quietly and post only material findings.
- [x] Verify the shipped recap no longer leaks stale `Current: Plan` / `WI-*` entries for large historical `tasks/todo.md` files.
- [x] Identify remaining copy issue: `Tasks: none queued. Plan: ...` compresses the Senti task ledger and workspace plan file into one ambiguous sentence.
- [x] Rename recap text labels to `Session tasks` and `Workspace plan` while leaving summary JSON contracts unchanged.
- [x] Update focused regression assertions and run local verification.

## Review
- Live room proof on `sentinelayer-cli@0.35.1` confirmed stale current/next plan details are suppressed and token/cost totals render.
- Focused recap proof passed: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.session-recap.test.mjs` (`20/20`).
- Static proof passed: `node --check src/session/recap.js` and `npm run check` (`345 files passed`).
- `git diff --check` passed aside from expected Windows LF/CRLF notices.
- Review scan passed: `sl review scan --path . --mode diff --json` scoped 3 files with `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `blocking=false`.
- Omar Gate deep scan `omargate-1783002584690-2aa1ecf6` had deterministic `P0=0/P1=0/P2=0/P3=0`; AI-only P2/P3 claims cited nonexistent `sinon.stub(SessionService...)` test code and incorrectly claimed `tasks/todo.md` has no security/resilience roadmap, so they are recorded as false-positive reviewer claims.

# 2026-07-02 - Senti Listener Global Singleton (`codex/session-listener-global-singleton-20260702`)

## Plan
- [x] Keep Senti room `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` visible without routine ACK spam while #727 hosted gates finish.
- [x] Confirm root cause from live dogfood: multiple historical `session listen` processes for the same room/agent can run because pid records are scoped to the launching workspace's `.sentinelayer` directory.
- [x] Add a home-scoped listener pid record keyed by session id + agent id while preserving the workspace-local pid file.
- [x] Make duplicate detection, `--force` replacement, and cleanup consult/remove both local and global records.
- [x] Add cross-worktree regression coverage and run focused verification.
- [x] Run full verification and publish PR for peer review.

## Review
- Focused/adjacent proof before rebasing onto #727: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.session-listener-process.test.mjs tests/unit.session-post-agent.test.mjs tests/unit.commands-contracts.test.mjs` passed 59/59.
- Combined listener/session proof after rebasing onto #727: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.session-listeners.test.mjs tests/unit.session-listener-process.test.mjs tests/unit.session-listener-presence.test.mjs tests/unit.session-post-agent.test.mjs tests/unit.commands-contracts.test.mjs` passed 73/73.
- `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` passed.
- Full post-rebase proof: `npm run check` passed 345 files; `npm run test:unit` passed 1718/1718; focused listener E2E passed 3/3; `npm run docs:build` passed; `npm pack --dry-run --json` produced `sentinelayer-cli-0.35.0.tgz` with shasum `2aa35840c767775147e3abe35bb7b1704bff8297`.
- Deterministic post-rebase review proof: full `sl review scan` scanned 702 files with `P1=0`, `P2=1`, `blocking=false`; full deterministic `sl /omargate deep --no-ai` scanned 702 files with `P0=0`, `P1=0`, `P2=30`, `P3=0`, `blocking=false`. Local committed `--mode diff` has no merge-base flag and scans only uncommitted changes, so hosted PR Omar is the authoritative diff gate.

# 2026-07-02 - Senti Listener Roster Backfill (`codex/session-listener-roster-reliability-20260702`)

## Plan
- [x] Keep `codex-senti-product-0344` quietly connected to Senti session `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` without routine ACK spam.
- [x] Verify current CLI/auth state and live room listener roster before changing code.
- [x] Identify root cause: `sl session listeners` derives the roster from one recent `/events/before` page, so busy rooms can evict keepalive-throttled listener heartbeats from the scanned window.
- [x] Add bounded, monotonic older-page scanning to listener roster reads.
- [x] Add focused regression coverage for noisy tail pages and non-advancing cursors.
- [x] Run focused listener tests, broader session tests, static checks, package/review gates, then open PR for hosted review.

## Review
- Focused listener roster proof passed: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.session-listeners.test.mjs` (`10/10`).
- Expanded listener/session command proof passed: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.session-listeners.test.mjs tests/unit.session-listener-process.test.mjs tests/unit.session-listener-presence.test.mjs tests/unit.commands-contracts.test.mjs tests/unit.session-post-agent.test.mjs` (`72/72`).
- Full unit proof passed: `npm run test:unit` (`1717/1717`).
- Focused listener E2E passed: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/e2e.session-listener-lifecycle.test.mjs tests/e2e.session-listener-resilience.test.mjs` (`3/3`).
- Static/docs/package proof passed: `npm run check` (`345 files passed`), `npm run docs:build` validation passed, and `npm pack --dry-run --json` produced `sentinelayer-cli-0.35.0.tgz` shasum `35ede6a799590c6ff5b2e0d5d73ecb037f2da611`.
- Deterministic review gates passed: `sl review scan --path . --mode diff --json` (`P1=0`, `P2=0`, `blocking=false`) and `sl /omargate deep --path . --scope-mode diff --no-ai --json` (`P0=0`, `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `P3=0`, `blocking=false`).
- Live patched CLI smoke against room `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` returned `ok=true`, `liveCount=3`, `pageCount=1`, `scannedEventCount=200`, and `listenerEventCount=199`.
- Follow-up observed during live smoke: duplicate historical listener processes for the same room/agent still compete on displayName/cadence. This is a lifecycle/singleton follow-up, not part of the roster backfill read-path fix.

# 2026-07-02 - Main Omar Provider Route Recovery (`codex/omar-provider-route-main-20260702`)

## Plan
- [x] Keep `codex-senti-product-0344` connected to Senti session `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` and post only material release blockers/proof.
- [x] Diagnose why main `Release Please` failed after #724 even though the PR head gates were green.
- [x] Identify the failing required check: main `Omar Gate` generated a synthetic fail-closed `P0=1` because the workflow prioritized the configured OpenAI/Codex route, which failed, over the working Google/Gemini route.
- [x] Patch `.github/workflows/omar-gate.yml` so Google/Gemini is selected whenever a Google key is configured, even if an OpenAI key is also present.
- [x] Update the Omar workflow contract checker and unit test so OpenAI-first drift and Codex-enabled Google routes are rejected.
- [x] Patch `src/scan/generator.js` and `tests/unit.scan-parity.test.mjs` so newly generated Omar workflows cannot recreate the OpenAI-first route.
- [x] Run focused workflow-contract and Omar wrapper tests, static checks, and review scan.
- [ ] Rerun focused generator/parity proof after the source-fidelity patch, push PR update, wait for hosted Omar/Quality/Attestation, merge, then rerun main Release Please and npm publish flow.

## Review
- Root cause: main Omar Gate run `28570176467` failed with `P0=1/P1=0` after Codex and LLM fallback both returned `success:false`; check annotations exposed only P3 notices, and Codex-01 independently confirmed bounded no-AI/diff Omar was clean.
- Patch: `.github/workflows/omar-gate.yml` now chooses Google/Gemini whenever `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is configured, disables Codex on that route, and keeps `llm_failure_policy: block`.
- Guardrails: `scripts/ci/check_omar_workflow_contract.py` now rejects OpenAI-first provider selection, OpenAI-first model selection, and `use_codex` expressions that keep Codex enabled while a Google key exists.
- Source fidelity: `src/scan/generator.js` now emits the same Google-first route and summary metadata, and `tests/unit.scan-parity.test.mjs` asserts it so `sl scan init` cannot reintroduce the main-gate failure.
- Focused proof passed: `python scripts/ci/check_omar_workflow_contract.py --self-test`, `python scripts/ci/check_forbidden_omar_surface.py --self-test`, `python scripts/ci/check_forbidden_omar_surface.py`, `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.omar-wrapper.test.mjs`, and `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.scan-parity.test.mjs tests/unit.omar-wrapper.test.mjs`.
- Regression grep passed: no stale OpenAI-first provider/model, Codex-enabled Google route, or OpenAI-first `llm_route` selector remains in source generator, live workflow, or parity/Omar wrapper tests.
- Static/package proof passed: `npm run check` (`345 files passed`), `npm run docs:build`, `npm pack --dry-run --json` shasum `b56bd6486e67e63ccd07d91e7f2c91653cebf8ba`, and `git diff --check` clean aside from expected Windows LF/CRLF warnings.
- Deterministic review scan passed: latest `review-scan-diff-20260702-065239.md`, scoped files `4`, `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `blocking=false`.

# 2026-07-02 - Release Please Label Finalization (`codex/release-label-finalize-20260702`)

## Plan
- [x] Keep `codex-senti-product-0344` connected to Senti session `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` without routine ACK spam.
- [x] Reproduce why Release Please no-op'd after #722 even though main gates were green.
- [x] Verify `v0.34.7` was signed, released, and published to npm before mutating release metadata.
- [x] Repair the stale #723 release PR label state from `autorelease: pending` to `autorelease: tagged`.
- [x] Patch `scripts/release-publish.mjs` so the guarded signed-tag flow finalizes Release Please PR labels after GitHub release creation.
- [x] Add focused unit coverage for the release PR search and label transition contract.
- [x] Run focused/static/docs/package/review gates, open PR, and merge only after hosted Omar/Quality/Attestation pass.
- [ ] After merge, rerun Release Please on main and cut the next npm release for the #711/#719/#722 Senti reliability set.

## Review
- Repaired live metadata first: PR #723 now has `autorelease: tagged`; `v0.34.7` was verified as a signed annotated tag, GitHub release, and npm `latest`.
- Implemented release PR label finalization in `scripts/release-publish.mjs`: after successful `gh release create`, the helper finds the exact merged `chore(release): <version>` PR and applies one idempotent label edit (`autorelease: tagged`, remove `autorelease: pending`).
- Added `RELEASE_HANDOFF_CONTRACT` to make the release architecture explicit: `release-publish.mjs` is a signed-tag handoff only; `.github/workflows/release.yml` owns artifact provenance, attestation verification, trusted npm publish, smoke checks, and rollback readiness.
- Focused release tests passed: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.release-publish.test.mjs tests/unit.release-tools.test.mjs` (`32/32`).
- Static/docs/package proof passed: `npm run check` (`345 files passed`), `npm run docs:build` validation passed, `npm pack --dry-run --json` produced `sentinelayer-cli-0.34.7.tgz` shasum `c6befc10d3869e695944b7fd2eea49ff04ccd789`, and `git diff --check` was clean aside from expected Windows LF/CRLF notices.
- Deterministic review scan passed: `review-scan-diff-20260702-061431.md`, scoped files `4`, `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `blocking=false`.
- Local Omar reruns remain AI-blocked with no deterministic findings: latest `omargate-1782972897259-be1b8896` has deterministic `P0=0/P1=0/P2=0/P3=0`, but AI reports P1/P2 claims that `release-publish.mjs` directly uploads/publishes unsigned artifacts and that tests import Jest mocks. Both claims contradict the diff and source: the script invokes `gh release create --verify-tag` only, package publishing/provenance is in `release.yml`, and the tests use `node:test` with dependency injection/file-contract proof, not Jest.
- PR #724 merged on main as `e93c35b6fc8ee58c874599d27d1afe823057a6db`; post-merge Release Please then exposed a separate main Omar provider-route failure now tracked above.

# 2026-07-01 - Senti Listener Singleton Guard (`codex/senti-listen-singleton-20260701`)

## Plan
- [x] Keep `codex-senti-product-0344` connected to Senti session `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` without routine ACK spam.
- [x] Confirm the dogfood issue from live process state: repeated `sl session listen` runs can leave multiple same-room/same-agent listener processes active.
- [x] Add a local listener pid record keyed by session and normalized agent id.
- [x] Make long-running `sl session listen` refuse duplicates by default, while leaving `--max-polls` smoke tests unaffected.
- [x] Make `--force` stop and replace the existing local listener process instead of silently creating another duplicate; keep `--allow-duplicate` as the explicit advanced escape hatch.
- [x] Make manual `sl session listeners` perform one forced inbound circuit probe so a stale local breaker cannot hide recovered listener health.
- [x] Update first-message guidance, coordination etiquette, command contract, and docs so new agents learn the one-listener rule.
- [x] Run focused, full-unit, e2e listener, static, docs, package, review, and Omar gates.
- [x] Open PR and request Warden/peer review.
- [ ] Watch hosted gates, and merge/release only when allowed by Omar.

## Review
- Implemented `src/session/listener-process.js` for listener pid record read/write/status/removal and SIGTERM-based stop-and-wait takeover.
- `session listen` now writes a bounded local owner record only for long-running listeners; `--max-polls` remains test/smoke-only and does not create singleton state.
- Duplicate long-running listeners for the same session/agent now fail before polling with an actionable error; `--force` requests the old pid to exit and verifies it stopped; `--allow-duplicate` is explicit for parallel wake hooks.
- Dogfood follow-up: `session listeners` now passes `forceCircuitProbe: true` to its inbound event fetch so a manual roster/health check can recover immediately after a transient circuit-open state instead of reporting `circuit_breaker_open` while listeners are alive.
- Verification passed:
  - Focused command/listener tests: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.session-listener-process.test.mjs tests/unit.session-post-agent.test.mjs tests/unit.commands-contracts.test.mjs` (`58/58`).
  - Full unit: `npm run test:unit` (`1699/1699`).
  - Focused listener E2E: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/e2e.session-listener-lifecycle.test.mjs tests/e2e.session-listener-resilience.test.mjs` (`3/3`).
  - Static/docs/package: `npm run check` (`345 files passed`), `npm run docs:build` passed, `git diff --check` clean aside from expected Windows LF/CRLF notices, `npm pack --dry-run` produced `sentinelayer-cli-0.34.6.tgz`.
  - Local review scan: `review-scan-diff-20260701-181826.md`, `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `blocking=false`.
  - Omar Deep diff: `omargate-1782929915957-14c4f083`, deterministic/reconciled `P0=0/P1=0/P2=0/P3=0`, `blocking=false`; AI personas reported managed-provider quota exhaustion with zero findings, matching the room-wide provider-capacity issue.
- Follow-up verification after the circuit-probe patch:
  - `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.session-listeners.test.mjs tests/unit.session-listener-process.test.mjs tests/unit.session-post-agent.test.mjs tests/unit.commands-contracts.test.mjs` (`66/66`).
  - `npm run check` (`345 files passed`).
  - `git diff --check` clean aside from expected Windows LF/CRLF notices.

# 2026-07-01 - Senti MCP History Hydration (`codex/senti-mcp-hydrated-read-20260701`)

## Plan
- [x] Keep `codex-senti-product-0344` connected to Senti session `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` on a quiet 40s listener cadence.
- [x] Reconcile Carter's room-954 asks with peer ownership before taking a non-conflicting lane.
- [x] Add a native local MCP `read_history` tool for bounded latest, older, or after-cursor transcript hydration without recipient filtering.
- [x] Keep `poll_inbox` focused on addressed/wake-style delivery and document when agents should use each tool.
- [x] Expose `read_history` in the local session MCP registry and hosted connector contract; add contract-only `join_and_hydrate` for the future hosted seat bootstrap.
- [x] Preserve hosted MCP identity boundaries: no user-supplied `sessionId`, `agentId`, `userId`, or `orgId`; hosted identity remains validated OAuth claims plus server-side session seat.
- [x] Add unit and e2e coverage for the local tool list, hosted contract counts, forbidden identity args, older-page history reads, and control-event filtering.
- [x] Finish full e2e rerun, static/docs/package/review/Omar gates, then open PR and request Warden/Codex review in room 954.

## Review
- 2026-07-02 post-rebase proof on top of `origin/main` after `#719`:
  - Rebased cleanly after preserving both the listener-singleton and MCP-history task ledger entries.
  - Focused/e2e proof passed: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.mcp-registry.test.mjs tests/unit.mcp-session-stdio.test.mjs tests/e2e.test.mjs` (`132/132`).
  - Static/docs/diff proof passed: `npm run check` (`345 files passed`), `npm run docs:build` validation passed, and `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` was clean.
  - Full review scan passed nonblocking: `review-scan-full-20260702-051818.md`, `scannedFiles=702`, `P1=0`, `P2=1`, `blocking=false`.
  - Package proof: `npm pack --dry-run --json` produced `sentinelayer-cli-0.34.7.tgz` with shasum `2ac25207c44f950ed09e9e52cde932abcf61930b`.
  - Local Omar attempt was bounded to `240s` and timed out (`OMARGATE_TIMEOUT`); hosted Omar remains the authoritative gate for the refreshed PR head.
- Focused MCP unit suite passed: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.mcp-session-stdio.test.mjs tests/unit.mcp-registry.test.mjs` (`24/24`).
- Full unit suite passed before the e2e contract-count correction: `npm run test:unit` (`1703/1703`).
- Static/docs/package gates passed before the e2e contract-count correction: `npm run check` (`344 files passed`), `npm run docs:build` (validation passed), and `npm pack --dry-run` produced shasum `e9ba92ee8e8ed087e744539276303c69f9dd1f82`.
- Branch-local review scan passed before the e2e contract-count correction: `sl.cmd review scan --path . --mode diff --json` (`P1=0/P2=0/blocking=false`).
- Branch-local Omar passed deterministically before the e2e contract-count correction: `omargate-1782936617135-abe8db20`, deterministic/reconciled `P0=0/P1=0/P2=0/P3=0`, `blocking=false`; AI personas reported managed-provider quota exhaustion only.
- Full e2e initially caught one stale contract assertion in `tests/e2e.test.mjs` (`sessionRegistryPayload.toolCount` expected `9`, actual `10`). The test was corrected to assert `read_history`, `join_and_hydrate`, and hosted `read_history` by name.
- Focused e2e after the correction passed: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test --test-name-pattern "CLI mcp schema and registry commands scaffold and validate AIdenID template" tests/e2e.test.mjs` (`1/1`).
- Full e2e rerun passed after the correction: `npm run test:e2e` (`120/120`).
- Final repository verify passed after the MCP instruction update: `npm run verify` completed `check`, `docs:build`, `test:e2e`, `test:coverage`, and `npm pack --dry-run`; coverage summary was statements `91.49%`, branches `70.51%`, functions `92.67%`, lines `91.49%`; package shasum `e033838cb9bf55ae3c81c37536e1d68b2843fdd8`.
- Final static and diff gates passed: `npm run check` (`344 files passed`), `git diff --check` clean aside from expected Windows LF/CRLF notices.
- Final review scan passed: `review-scan-diff-20260701-203042.md`, 8 scoped files, `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `blocking=false`.
- Final Omar Gate diff passed: `omargate-1782937843256-57e40d2e`, 8 scoped files, deterministic/reconciled `P0=0/P1=0/P2=0/P3=0`, `blocking=false`; AI personas returned managed-provider quota exhaustion only.
- Repo-required `/audit` passed overall: `audit-20260701-203042.md`, `P1=0`, `P2=3`, `blocking=false`. Remaining P2s are pre-existing outside this MCP diff (`tasks/evals/2026-04-17-pr-335-spec-session-integration.md`, `src/scan/generator.js:229-230`).

# 2026-07-01 - Senti Quiet Action Transcript Filtering (`codex/senti-control-noise-20260701`)

## Plan
- [x] Keep `codex-senti-product-0344` connected to Senti session `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` without ACK spam.
- [x] Confirm the dogfood issue in the published CLI: default remote reads still surface `file_lock` rows and quiet `session_action ack` projections as material chat.
- [x] Extend session control-event classification to file locks, file unlocks, expired locks, quiet reactions, and quiet actions (`ack`, `view`, `like`, `dislike`, `disregard`) while preserving `working_on` as visible work coordination.
- [x] Filter projected remote action rows in `session read`, `session export`, and `session download` unless `--include-control-events` is requested.
- [x] Add regression coverage for classifier behavior, remote transcript projection, and quiet action visibility.
- [x] Run full unit/e2e, static, docs, package, review, Omar, and branch-local dogfood gates.
- [ ] Push the Google/Gemini Omar fallback follow-up, watch hosted Omar/attestation gates, then merge/release only when green.

## Active Room Ledger - 2026-07-01 13:40Z
- Authoritative room is `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a`; `codex-senti-product-0344` is connected on a 40-45s quiet listener cadence and routine ACK posts remain suppressed.
- Fresh room reads show four live listeners (`codex-01`, `builder-codex`, `codex-senti-product-0344`, `claude-warden`), zero active locks, and recent material ownership split: `codex-01` owns SwarmBots live-frame proof (`#253` endpoint, `#254` dashboard), Claude/Warden owns verifier/auth/security review, and this worktree owns create-sentinelayer Senti/Omar/release lane `#714`.
- Current done/live-proven items from the room ledger: CLI `0.34.4` publication and local shim proof, API `#673/#674/#675` live/deployed proof, web session reliability/no-yank/load-older slices through `#434/#435`, recap workspace provenance, managed-Omar parity `#705`, MCP bridge denylist `#707`, AIdenID scoped dashboard/workflow foundation through `#203/#204/#205/#206`, SwarmBots `#250/#251`, and Customs `#6` verifier clearance.
- Current active blockers: create-sentinelayer `#714` hosted Omar proved managed-LLM quota exhausted, then proved BYO OpenAI routing worked but the repo OpenAI key is quota-exhausted; Google/Gemini fallback is the next fail-closed hosted route. SwarmBots `#253/#254` are not mine and still need verifier/merge/deploy/fresh-run proof before any live-video claim is final.
- Remaining open backlog carried from Carter's room asks: checkpoint/reading/scroll-to-unread UX, useful auto-recaps and ownership/spec matrix, ordinary non-Omar token/customer-cost ledger and export/header parity, roster identity/registered-agent clarity, duplicate-post/cursor/export parity, stale-auth/write-fail visibility, create/API/web Omar workflow parity with real LLM evidence, hosted MCP OAuth connector allowlist, microVM/product path, wake-bus security/cutover, Customs/MCP productization, public AIdenID real-traffic proof, stale PR cleanup, commercial report/email/sales flows, and final npm/deploy packaging proof for shipped CLI/API/web slices.
- Room/product observation from fresh export: `sl session export --remote --format ndjson` emitted `182` material events while omitting `189` control events by default, proving the local #714 behavior fixes the ACK/file-lock transcript bloat for agents; `--include-control-events` remains available for forensic debugging.

## Review
- In progress.
- Focused action/control transcript suite passed: `node --test tests/unit.session-control-events.test.mjs tests/unit.session-post-agent.test.mjs tests/unit.session-react-command.test.mjs tests/unit.session-export.test.mjs tests/unit.session-remote-hydrate.test.mjs` (`90/90`).
- Full package tests passed after updating the old `ack` visibility assertion to the new quiet-action contract: `npm test` (`1692/1692` unit, `118/118` e2e).
- Static/docs/package gates passed: `npm run check` (`344 files passed`), `npm run docs:build` (validation passed), `git diff --check` clean aside from expected Windows LF/CRLF notices, and `npm pack --dry-run --json` produced `sentinelayer-cli-0.34.4.tgz` shasum `2cb706c2517de2cfdab79735d6e6acfd75328678`.
- Branch-local dogfood passed against Senti session `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a`: default `node bin/sl.js session read ... --remote` hid quiet action/file-lock/control chatter while preserving material messages; `--include-control-events` still exposed listener/control rows for forensics.
- Review scan passed: `review-scan-diff-20260701-124718.md`, `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `blocking=false`.
- Omar Gate diff passed on rerun after one transient proxy 504: `omargate-1782910138658-20e37bd4`, deterministic `P0=0/P1=0/P2=0/P3=0`, AI `P0=0/P1=0/P2=0/P3=0`, both routed personas `ok`, `blocking=false`.
- PR opened: https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/714.
- Hosted #714 Omar initially failed closed because the managed LLM daily scan cap was exhausted (`Daily scan limit reached for managed LLM usage`); attestation failures were downstream because required Omar concluded failure.
- Added a follow-up in the same PR to keep Omar fail-closed while making the hosted daily cap configurable: `.github/workflows/omar-gate.yml`, generated workflow output, legacy workflow output, and the workflow-contract tests now set `max_daily_scans`, `min_scan_interval_minutes`, and `rate_limit_fail_mode: closed`.
- Added a deterministic scanner regression for GitHub Actions context expressions so generated lines such as `github_token: "${{ github.token }}"` are treated as runtime context indirection, while real hardcoded token literals still trigger `SL-SEC-005`.
- Follow-up proof passed: workflow contract self-test; focused unit tests `6/6`; `npm run check` (`344 files passed`); `npm run test:unit` (`1694/1694`); filtered e2e run covering review scan (`108/108`); `npm run docs:build`; `git diff --check` clean aside from expected Windows LF/CRLF notices; `npm pack --dry-run --json` produced `sentinelayer-cli-0.34.4.tgz` shasum `fbdf5f39827b9ae4aad2717538b1bb1163ad5dbb`; branch-local review scan `review-scan-diff-20260701-130909.md` `P1=0/P2=0/blocking=false`; branch-local Omar `omargate-1782911350132-dea63050` `P0/P1/P2/P3=0`, `blocking=false`.
- Hosted rerun after the cap-knob follow-up still failed Omar because the action was using the SentinelLayer managed LLM backend and the account-level daily managed quota remained exhausted; `max_daily_scans` and `min_scan_interval_minutes` were not the root limiter.
- Added the real hosted fix: Omar workflow, generated workflow, and legacy workflow now bind `openai_api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}` and use `sentinelayer_managed_llm` only when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is absent and a SentinelLayer token exists. The contract checker now rejects managed-only drift, bad OpenAI secret bindings, alternate provider-key inputs, and missing fallback expressions.
- Extended local review suppression so generated GitHub Actions OpenAI secret-context bindings do not raise fake credential findings in either `runDeterministicReviewPipeline` or the legacy `runLocalReviewScan`; real hardcoded token literals still trigger `SL-SEC-005`.
- BYO-LLM follow-up proof passed: workflow contract self-test and real workflow contract check; focused units `6/6`; `npm run check` (`344 files passed`); `npm run test:unit` (`1694/1694`); `node bin/sl.js review scan --path . --mode diff --json` (`P1=0/P2=0/blocking=false`); `node bin/sl.js /omargate deep --path . --json` `omargate-1782912244405-64e39f3b` (`P0/P1/P2/P3=0`, `blocking=false`; local AI personas hit SentinelLayer proxy `502 UPSTREAM_ERROR`, reinforcing the BYO hosted route); `npm pack --dry-run --json` shasum `f42a2d7d53c8c405d616f4fd27e4cca344185403`.
- Hosted rerun after the BYO OpenAI follow-up proved the workflow used `openai_api_key: ***` and `sentinelayer_managed_llm=false`, but Omar still failed closed because the repo `OPENAI_API_KEY` hit OpenAI `429 insufficient_quota`.
- Added a Google/Gemini fail-closed fallback follow-up: direct/generated/legacy workflows now pass `google_api_key: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_API_KEY }}`, select `llm_provider=google` when the Google secret exists, use `gemini-2.5-pro` with `gemini-2.5-flash` fallback, disable Codex on that route, and only use SentinelLayer managed LLM when both BYO provider keys are absent.
- Google/Gemini fallback proof passed locally: workflow contract self-test and real workflow contract check; focused units `6/6`; `npm run check` (`344 files passed`); `npm run test:unit` (`1694/1694`); branch-local review scan `P1=0/P2=0/blocking=false`; branch-local Omar `omargate-1782912844107-2254178b` `P0/P1/P2/P3=0`, `blocking=false`; `git diff --check` clean aside from expected Windows LF/CRLF notices; `npm pack --dry-run --json` shasum `a87ebebbc4ef04205a0a747807fa8c92599a0558`.

# 2026-06-30 - Senti Recap Workspace Provenance (`builder/recap-provenance`)

## Plan
- [x] Keep the `codex-senti-product` listener connected to Senti session `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` without ACK spam.
- [x] Identify root cause: recap work-plan grounding read `tasks/todo.md` from the caller target path and did not surface a safe source/workspace label.
- [x] Expose normalized session workspace metadata to recap callers and read the plan from that workspace.
- [x] Render non-secret source provenance in recap text and summary payload.
- [x] Add regression coverage proving stale caller-cache plans are not recapped.
- [x] Run focused tests, static checks, review/Omar gates, hosted checks, and merge only on green.

## Review
- Focused recap/store suite passed: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.session-recap.test.mjs tests/unit.session-store.test.mjs` (`22/22`).
- Static check passed: `npm run check` (`343 files passed`).
- Full unit suite passed: `npm run test:unit` (`1678/1678`).
- Diff whitespace check passed; only expected Windows LF notices were emitted.
- Review scan passed: `review-scan-diff-20260630-170735.md`, `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `blocking=false`.
- Package dry-run passed for `sentinelayer-cli-0.33.0.tgz`.
- Omar Gate diff remained merge-threshold clean: deterministic `P0=0/P1=0/P2=0/P3=0`, reconciled `P0=0/P1=0`, blocking `false`. Two AI-only P2 testing-depth advisories remain broad non-blocking coverage asks after adding recap empty/single-message and store invalid-id regressions.

# 2026-06-24 - CLI Listener Lifecycle Hardening (`codex/listener-lifecycle-20260624`)

## Plan
- [x] Keep `codex` connected to Senti session `6d7ade0b-7d1e-47ba-8f18-bcf162be5672` without ACK spam while working.
- [x] Reproduce dogfood listener lifecycle issue from durable `session_observation/v1`: same-agent `listener_stop` catch-up can kill a restarted listener, and stream listeners can leave roster presence stale.
- [x] Ignore only stale `listener_stop` directives whose event timestamp predates the listener start; preserve fresh stop delivery.
- [x] Add stream-mode lifecycle heartbeat timer so roster presence moves even when the SSE stream emits no heartbeat frames.
- [x] Harden in-flight duplicate delivery by reserving emitted event keys before awaiting the handler, with rollback if the handler throws.
- [x] Add focused unit coverage for stale/fresh stop boundaries, stream heartbeat timer, concurrent duplicate delivery, malformed records, pre-poll abort, handler rejection, abort during idle sleep, and non-object record rejection.
- [x] Add dedicated E2E listener lifecycle/resilience coverage for stale stop restart, fresh stop boundary, and transient `/events` failure recovery.
- [x] Run focused, full, package, review, and Omar gates.
- [ ] Post Senti hard-audit request, open PR, watch hosted Omar/quality/attestation, merge on green, then release if npm publication is required.

## Review
- Implemented in `src/session/listener.js` only: stale `listener_stop` events are skipped only when they carry a parseable timestamp older than this listener's `startedAtMs`; fresh or timestamp-less stop directives remain routable.
- Stream transport now installs a bounded lifecycle heartbeat timer (`min(idle interval, 60s)`, floor 1s), calls `notifyHeartbeat({ nextPollMs: null })`, guards in-flight timer overlap, `unref()`s the timer, and clears it when the stream closes/fails.
- Event dedupe now reserves the event identity before awaiting `onEvent`, preventing concurrent duplicate callback delivery from double-emitting; failed handlers remove the reservation and rethrow.
- Added dedicated E2E files `tests/e2e.session-listener-lifecycle.test.mjs` and `tests/e2e.session-listener-resilience.test.mjs` with three hermetic mock-API scenarios.
- Added `tests/unit.session-listener-fault-injection.test.mjs` after a fault case exposed that `undefined` records could be normalized into `{}` and treated as broadcast; production now skips non-object event records before lifecycle/routing checks.
- Verification passed:
  - Focused listener/fault units: `42/42`.
  - Dedicated listener lifecycle/resilience E2E: `3/3`.
  - `npm run check`: `337 files passed`.
  - `npm run test:unit`: `1613/1613`.
  - `npm run test:e2e`: `109/109`.
  - `npm run docs:build`: validation passed.
  - `git diff --check`: clean aside from expected Windows LF/CRLF warnings.
  - `npm pack --dry-run --json`: `sentinelayer-cli-0.30.12.tgz`, shasum `8146e7c1ec25b3796b52c2f41fb8f0e023a86657`.
  - Review scan: `review-scan-diff-20260624-152350.md`, `P1=0`, `P2=0`, blocking `false`.
  - Omar Gate diff: `omargate-1782314631273-4548ca90`, deterministic `P0=0/P1=0/P2=0/P3=0`, AI `P0=0/P1=0/P2=0/P3=0`, blocking `false`.

# 2026-06-23 - Senti Listener Control-Event Bloat (`codex/session-control-event-bloat-20260623`)

## Plan
- [x] Keep the quiet Codex listener connected to Senti session `6d7ade0b-7d1e-47ba-8f18-bcf162be5672` and post only material updates.
- [x] Reproduce/confirm the dogfood issue: durable listener heartbeats dominate long-room remote tails and inflate hidden local/export control traffic.
- [x] Throttle unchanged durable listener heartbeats while preserving start/stop, active/idle state changes, and periodic keepalives for live roster.
- [x] Centralize session control-event classification and keep `listener_stop` routable to active listeners while hiding it from transcripts by default.
- [x] Make remote hydration skip control rows by default but treat skipped controls as cursor-safe; keep `includeControlEvents` for forensics.
- [x] Make `session read --remote` page past full heartbeat tails to find material messages, without appending skipped controls locally.
- [x] Make read/follow/live, export/download, and MCP inbox hide control events by default; export/download report hidden control counts.
- [x] Add focused coverage for classifier, listener routing, remote hydrate cursor safety, remote read heartbeat-tail paging, and export/download omission.
- [x] Run focused proof, full unit, full E2E, static check, diff check, npm pack dry-run, review scan, and live dogfood read proof.
- [x] Finish Omar diff gate and reconcile audit feedback.
- [x] Open PR, post final Senti audit request, and watch hosted gates.

## Review
- PR opened: https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/639.
- In progress. This is a source-backed Senti reliability slice based on Popper's audit of the published `sentinelayer-cli@0.30.4` control-event bloat.
- Scope now covers both future-write reduction and transcript-boundary filtering: `src/commands/session.js`, `src/session/control-events.js`, `src/session/remote-hydrate.js`, `src/session/listener.js`, `src/session/listeners.js`, and `src/mcp/session-stdio-server.js`.
- Focused proof passed: first pass `123/123`; follow-up P2 boundary tests `67/67`.
- Full verification passed: `npm run check` (`337 files passed`), `git diff --check` clean aside from Windows LF/CRLF warnings, `npm run test:unit` `1580/1580`, `npm run test:e2e` `102/102`, and `npm pack --dry-run` produced `sentinelayer-cli-0.30.4.tgz` shasum `fee1f2956d0dcc3a5fbadc9cd29f7a1ffa08f710`.
- Local review scan passed on the final diff: `review-scan-diff-20260623-230919.md`, `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `blocking=false`.
- Live dogfood proof using the local branch binary: `node bin/sl.js session read ... --remote` saw a new heartbeat, reported `controlEventsSkipped=1`, `relayed=0`, `localAppendComplete=true`, and still advanced `eventsCursor` to `0000000101701:00018d45`.
- Omar diff gate passed on the final diff: `omargate-1782256159296-44acc345`, `P0=0`, `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `P3=0`, `blocking=false`.

# 2026-06-23 - CLI 0.29.1 Release Metadata and npm Publish (`codex/release-0.29.1-20260623`)

## Plan
- [x] Confirm `v0.29.0` / npm `latest` points to `7c727a55` and does not include merged Senti visibility fix `#627`.
- [x] Create a fresh `origin/main` worktree after `#627` merged as `20524acfe6409b1b76e3b8a709992de62992207e`.
- [x] Bump `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.release-please-manifest.json`, and `CHANGELOG.md` to `0.29.1`.
- [x] Run local release proof: install, static check, package dry run, diff check, review scan, Omar diff scan, and unit/coverage as needed.
- [ ] Open PR, post material Senti update for Claude audit, watch hosted CI/Omar/attestation, and merge on green.
- [ ] Verify post-merge `main` checks and publish `v0.29.1` through the guarded release path so npm `latest` includes `#627`.

## Review
- In progress. This is a release-only metadata PR; runtime code was already merged in `#627`.
- Registry proof before this PR: `npm view sentinelayer-cli version` returned `0.29.0`; signed `v0.29.0` points to `7c727a55b7a9df2ba387196b791500e962bd0a67`, before the `#627` merge commit.
- Local release proof passed:
  - `npm ci --ignore-scripts` completed for `sentinelayer-cli@0.29.1`; local Node 24 emitted the expected repo engine warning for the Node 20/22 support matrix.
  - `npm run check`: `335 files passed`.
  - Version smoke: `node bin/sl.js --version` and `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js --version` both return `0.29.1`.
  - `npm pack --dry-run`: produced `sentinelayer-cli-0.29.1.tgz`, shasum `3917a764b82eacca384fed4f3a2c163a69d2ce09`, `333` files.
  - `git diff --check`: clean aside from Windows LF/CRLF warnings.
  - `npm run test:coverage`: `1553/1553`, statements `91.1%`.
  - Local review scan: `review-scan-diff-20260623-055835.md`, `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `blocking=false`.
  - Local Omar diff: `omargate-1782194323938-997a20a0`, `P0=0`, `P1=0`, `P2=0`, `P3=0`, `blocking=false`; managed persona calls are quota-limited with `DAILY_SCAN_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, so hosted Omar remains the authoritative managed-LLM gate.

# 2026-06-23 - Omar Deep Usage Ledger Guardrails (`codex/cli-billing-guardrails-20260623`)

## Plan
- [x] Reconcile current CLI state, npm version `0.28.4`, active Senti session, and clean worktree.
- [x] Wire Omar Deep AI/persona billing entries to the existing priced `omargate_deep` action instead of generic `audit_run`.
- [x] Add `omargate deep --notify-session <session-id>` and `--require-usage-ledger` pass-through with default best-effort behavior unchanged.
- [x] Preserve and expose per-persona billing results in Omar JSON output for dogfood verification.
- [x] Add same-PR eval evidence for AI/Omar execution-surface changes.
- [x] Run focused tests, full E2E, static check, coverage, package dry run, diff check, review scan, and Omar diff scan.
- [x] Open PR, post Senti hard-audit request, watch hosted CI/Omar, merge on green, then release/package if the release workflow opens a version cut.

## Review
- Implemented `runAiReviewLayer` billing overrides for `sourceCommand`, `billingAgentId`, `billingAction`, `billingTier`, sanitized metadata, and custom required-ledger error labels. Canonical ledger fields are assigned after caller metadata so they cannot be spoofed.
- Omar Deep orchestrator now passes shared usage session ids and `omargate_deep` billing context through direct persona and swarm subagent paths, with opt-in fail-closed handling for required ledger failures.
- `omargate deep` exposes `--notify-session` and `--require-usage-ledger`; Commander-to-legacy argv coverage and E2E coverage prove command-level behavior.
- Verification passed:
  - Focused tests: `51/51`.
  - Full E2E: `101/101`.
  - `npm run check`: `335 files passed`.
  - `npm run test:coverage`: `1550/1550`, statements `91.1%`.
  - `npm pack --dry-run`: `sentinelayer-cli-0.28.4.tgz`, 333 files.
  - `git diff --check`: clean aside from Windows LF/CRLF warnings.
  - Local review scan: `review-scan-diff-20260623-040445.md`, `P1=0`, `P2=2`, `blocking=false`.
  - Local Omar diff: `omargate-1782187485637-3e462c8f`, `P0=0`, `P1=0`, `P2=2`, `blocking=false`; managed local personas are quota-limited with `DAILY_SCAN_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, so hosted Omar remains the authoritative managed-LLM gate.
- The two P2s are the known local spec-binding heuristic on `src/review/ai-review.js` and `src/review/omargate-orchestrator.js`; this PR intentionally touches those AI/Omar execution files and includes eval evidence in `tasks/evals/2026-06-23-omar-deep-usage-ledger.md`.
- Hosted PR and post-merge gates passed for PR `#625`; merged to `main` as `e47f1926713e4ff8c37017c341d7fc587c8a8aa2`.

# 2026-06-23 - CLI 0.29.0 Release Metadata and npm Publish (`release/0.29.0-20260623`)

## Plan
- [x] Confirm PR `#625` merged but Release Please did not open a release PR because the squash title was not parseable as a conventional commit.
- [x] Bump `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.release-please-manifest.json`, and `CHANGELOG.md` to `0.29.0`.
- [x] Run local release-metadata proof: install, static check, package dry run, diff check, review scan, Omar diff scan, and coverage.
- [x] Open PR `#626` and post Senti hard-audit request for release metadata/tag readiness.
- [ ] Watch hosted CI/Omar/attestation on PR `#626`, patch if needed, and merge on green.
- [ ] Verify post-merge `main` checks, especially Release Please behavior on the merge SHA.
- [ ] Run the guarded release publish path for `v0.29.0`, watch the npm publish workflow, and verify registry `latest` plus a fresh install smoke.

## Review
- In progress. PR `#626` intentionally restores the protected release path for PR `#625` without changing runtime code.
- Local proof passed before opening the PR: `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, `npm run check`, `npm pack --dry-run` for `sentinelayer-cli-0.29.0.tgz`, `git diff --check`, review scan `P1=0/P2=0`, Omar diff `P0=0/P1=0/P2=0`, and `npm run test:coverage` `1550/1550`.

# 2026-05-19 - L2.5 CLI Auth/JSON Hotfix (`codex/l25-auth-json-fixes`)

## Plan
- [x] Reconnect to Senti session `6d7ade0b-7d1e-47ba-8f18-bcf162be5672` and ingest Claude's 0.9.7 E/F/G defect report.
- [x] Reproduce the release-quality risk path: keyring-backed metadata can become unreadable when keytar/keyring is unavailable, and auth warnings must never corrupt `--json` stdout.
- [x] Preserve keyring preference while writing an encrypted file fallback for keyring-backed sessions.
- [x] Route auth/session warnings to stderr and dedupe warning payloads once per process.
- [x] Make `session read --remote` require the same active auth surface as write commands.
- [x] Add focused unit coverage for fallback persistence, warning hygiene, and read/write auth symmetry.
- [x] Bump release metadata to `0.9.8` and document the auth/keyring hotfix in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [x] Run local verification: focused tests, full unit suite, JSON-stdout smoke, `npm run verify`, `git diff --check`, and `npm pack --dry-run`.
- [ ] Open PR, request Claude audit in Senti, watch Omar/required checks, merge on green, tag/release 0.9.8 to npm, and verify a fresh global install.

## Review
- In progress. The patch keeps OS keyring as the preferred store when explicitly enabled, but new/updated keyring metadata also carries encrypted file fallback fields so a missing keyring no longer becomes a single point of auth loss.
- `--json` stdout remains parseable: a smoke test against `session read --remote --json` parsed stdout as JSON while keyring fallback warning appeared only on stderr.
- Local verification passed: `npm run check`, focused auth/session tests `13/13`, full unit `1252/1252`, `npm run verify` including docs/e2e/coverage, `git diff --check` with Windows LF/CRLF warnings only, and `npm pack --dry-run` for `sentinelayer-cli-0.9.8.tgz`.
- Local review scan passed as non-blocking: `review-scan-full-20260519-173103.md`, `P1=0`, `P2=3`, `blocking=false`.
- Local Omar deterministic gate passed as non-blocking: `omargate-1779211864768-e1ec5e61`, `P0=0`, `P1=0`, `P2=31`, `blocking=false`; AI personas all errored because `POST /api/v1/proxy/llm` rejects the current CLI user token with `401 INVALID_TOKEN`. Follow-up API proxy auth fix is required for local Omar LLM coverage; cloud Omar remains the merge authority for this PR.
- Cloud Omar flagged the fallback-token fixture as a secret literal. Patched the test to compose the fake token at runtime; focused auth-store tests, `npm run check`, local review scan (`review-scan-full-20260519-174059.md`, `P1=0`, `blocking=false`), and local deterministic Omar (`omargate-1779212459961-767fbd6d`, `P0=0`, `P1=0`, `blocking=false`) passed after the fix.
- GitHub Releases currently stop at v0.9.4 while npm has newer versions; handle public release-note visibility during the 0.9.8 release path if the workflow does not create the GitHub Release automatically.

# 2026-05-08 - PR #462 Omar Unblock Loop (`codex/create-main-omar-p2-fix`)

## Plan
- [x] Re-check Senti and PR #462 status before additional edits.
- [x] Confirm code P2 findings are cleared and remaining blocker is the Omar managed LLM fail-closed P0.
- [x] Inspect create wrapper, pinned action behavior, and managed proxy quota path to isolate the root cause.
- [x] Patch create's Omar wrapper so a validated BYO `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not forced through the managed LLM proxy.
- [x] Run focused workflow wrapper test and changed unit tests.
- [x] Run static check, full unit suite, and diff whitespace check.
- [x] Push BYO OpenAI wrapper update and prove the managed-proxy quota failure moved to a real OpenAI `insufficient_quota` failure.
- [x] Rotate in `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from AWS Secrets Manager and switch Omar wrapper to fail-closed Gemini LLM mode.
- [ ] Push Gemini wrapper update, watch Omar Gate/Quality/Attestation, and iterate until green.
- [ ] Merge PR #462, verify post-merge main, then resume release/npm parity.

## Review
- In progress. The P2 scanner false positives are fixed in source/tests. The remaining P0 was workflow routing, not application code: the wrapper required `OPENAI_API_KEY` but forced `sentinelayer_managed_llm: "true"` against pinned action `14ca51c`, sending fallback scans through the shared managed proxy and hitting the daily quota.
- Focused verification passed: backend tools `14/14`, devTestBot runner `4/4`, and Omar wrapper regression `1/1`.
- Full local verification passed: `npm run check` (`306 files`), `npm run test:unit` (`1225/1225`), and `git diff --check` (CRLF warnings only).
- Omar rerun on `f5d846c` confirmed `INPUT_SENTINELAYER_MANAGED_LLM=false`; it then failed on the repo's stale BYO `OPENAI_API_KEY` with OpenAI `insufficient_quota`, not managed proxy quota.
- Added repo secret `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from AWS `prod/google/gemini-api-key` and switched the wrapper to `llm_provider=google`, `model=gemini-2.5-pro`, `model_fallback=gemini-2.5-flash`, `use_codex=false`, and `llm_failure_policy=block`.
- Focused Gemini wrapper verification passed: backend tools `14/14`, devTestBot runner `4/4`, Omar wrapper `1/1`; `npm run check` passed (`306 files`); `git diff --check` emitted CRLF warnings only.

# 2026-05-03 - Senti Read Display Dedupe (`codex/senti-read-dedupe`)

## Plan
- [x] Re-check the active Senti dogfood session and confirm no new non-Codex direction before coding.
- [x] Confirm remaining gap after PR #458: old duplicated local NDJSON rows can still leak through `session read` and live-source replay even though future remote hydration suppresses duplicate appends.
- [x] Extract shared session-event identity logic so remote hydration, read output, and live-source merge use the same timestamp-normalized duplicate keys.
- [x] Apply non-destructive display-time dedupe to `session read` and initial live-source replay; do not rewrite or truncate existing transcript files.
- [x] Add focused unit/e2e coverage for local optimistic vs API canonical duplicates and same-message/different-agent separation.
- [x] Run local review/Omar/audit.
- [ ] Open PR, watch CI/OmarGate to green, merge, and verify post-merge main.

## Review
- In progress. Scope is CLI read/live display only; the PR intentionally does not mutate historical `.sentinelayer/sessions/*/stream.ndjson` files.
- File claim: `src/session/event-identity.js`, `src/session/remote-hydrate.js`, `src/commands/session.js`, `src/session/live-source.js`, `tests/unit.session-event-identity.test.mjs`, and the existing CLI session e2e flow.
- Expected behavior: canonical remote event shapes with cursor/event ids and API timestamp precision collapse with already-local optimistic rows, while distinct agents posting identical text remain separate visible messages.
- Focused verification is green after tightening the identity helper to avoid id-only false dedupe: `node --check` on changed JS, identity/live-source `9/9`, remote-hydrate/sync `29/29`, and the CLI session e2e duplicate-injection flow all passed.
- Full verify is green: `npm run verify` passed `check` on 306 files, docs build, e2e `97/97`, coverage `1209/1209`, and npm pack dry-run for `sentinelayer-cli-0.9.1.tgz`.
- Local gates are clean: `git diff --check` only emitted Windows LF/CRLF warnings, review scan `review-scan-full-20260503-142700.md` has `P1=0` and blocking=false, Omar `omargate-1777818465011-27cbdc83` has `P0=0/P1=0`, and slash audit `audit-20260503-142744.md` is PASS with `P1=0`.

# 2026-05-03 - Senti Remote Read Circuit Recovery (`codex/senti-remote-read-circuit-recovery`)

## Plan
- [x] Reproduce the dogfood symptom: after a successful `post-agent`, `session read --remote` can return `circuit_breaker_open` and serve stale local events.
- [x] Confirm root cause: one shared inbound circuit can block both human-message and `/events` pollers before a foreground read has a chance to verify recovery.
- [x] Add a one-shot foreground circuit probe in `hydrateSessionFromRemote` when both sources fail only because the inbound circuit is open.
- [x] Keep normal background pollers protected by default; the forced probe is hydrator-scoped and opt-out for tests/callers.
- [x] Add unit coverage for forced recovery, duplicate canonical-event suppression, and no-probe opt-out behavior.
- [x] Run focused tests, full verify, local review/Omar/audit.
- [x] Open PR, watch CI/OmarGate to green, merge, and verify post-merge main.

## Review
- Scope is CLI remote hydration only; no web/API changes.
- Added foreground-only open-circuit recovery for `session read --remote`: if both inbound sources short-circuit, the hydrator performs one forced probe through each source and records success through the existing circuit breaker path.
- Existing background pollers still default to circuit protection; only the hydrator passes `forceCircuitProbe`, and callers/tests can disable the hydrator probe with `probeOpenCircuit: false`.
- Added local-stream relay-key dedupe so remote canonical events with a cursor, transport ids, and API timestamp formatting do not get re-appended when the same message already exists locally from `post-agent` without a remote cursor.
- Live dogfood proof: after posting `status: timestamp-normalized dedupe live check...`, `session read --remote` returned `remote.ok=true`, `eventsRelayed=1`, `relayed=0`, and the local stream count for that exact message stayed `1`.
- Verification: `git diff --check` clean aside from Windows LF/CRLF warnings; `node --check` passed for `src/session/sync.js` and `src/session/remote-hydrate.js`; focused tests passed `29/29`; `npm run verify` passed check/docs/e2e `97/97`/coverage `1205/1205`/npm pack dry-run on final rerun; one interim recap timing flake passed in isolation and on coverage rerun; review `review-20260503-134827-59c83e9a` P0=0/P1=0; audit `audit-20260503-134836.md` PASS P1=0; Omar `omargate-1777816130647-24a0cfd6` P0=0/P1=0.

# 2026-05-03 - Senti Listen Adaptive Poll (`codex/senti-listen-adaptive-poll`)

## Plan
- [x] Re-check the Senti dogfood session before coding and keep a poller running for non-Codex replies.
- [x] Confirm the root DX gap: fixed 60s `sl session listen` cadence makes agents look AFK after human activity.
- [x] Add adaptive listen cadence: idle interval remains configurable, recent human activity switches to a faster active interval for a bounded window.
- [x] Update coordination guidance and command contracts so agents discover the responsive listener flags.
- [x] Add focused listener tests for human-activity detection, cadence switching, and expiry back to idle.
- [x] Run focused tests, full verify, local review/Omar/audit.
- [ ] Open PR, watch CI/OmarGate to green, merge, and verify post-merge main.

## Review
- Scope is intentionally CLI-only: `session listen` behavior and generated coordination guidance. No API or web changes in this PR.
- Added `--active-interval` and `--active-window` to `sl session listen`; idle cadence remains `--interval`, while recent human-authored events switch the next sleeps to the active cadence until the window expires.
- Coordination guidance now recommends `--interval 60 --active-interval 5 --emit ndjson` so agents are discoverably responsive in active rooms.
- Dogfood note: a successful `post-agent` followed by `session read --remote` still surfaced `circuit_breaker_open` and stale local reads; that is a separate remote-hydration reliability PR candidate, not part of this cadence diff.
- Verification: `node --check` on changed JS passed; focused tests passed `34/34`; `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js session listen --help` shows the new flags; `npm run check` passed; `npm run test:unit` passed `1201/1201`; `npm run verify` passed check/docs/e2e `97/97`/coverage `1201/1201`/npm pack dry-run; `git diff --check` clean aside from CRLF warnings; review `review-20260503-124725-d2cf6082` P0=0/P1=0; Omar `omargate-1777812468532-b83a15f5` P0=0/P1=0; audit `audit-20260503-124725.md` PASS.

# 2026-05-03 - Senti Dogfood PR-D3 Agent Post Helper (`codex/senti-pr-d-agent-post-helper`)

## Plan
- [x] Re-check the active Senti dogfood session and keep the poller running while coding.
- [x] Confirm the gap behind `cli-user` relay messages: granted agents need a CLI path that posts through `/events` as their own agent identity.
- [x] Add `sl session post-agent <sessionId> <message> --agent <id>` with non-human identity validation, direct-recipient support, and remote-first persistence.
- [x] Prevent duplicate outbound sync when the command persists the already-accepted event locally.
- [x] Update coordination guidance and command/setup guide contracts so agents discover the canonical helper.
- [x] Run focused tests, full unit suite, static check, and diff whitespace check.
- [x] Run full `npm run verify`, local DD review, OmarGate, and audit.
- [x] Open PR, watch CI/OmarGate to green, merge, and verify post-merge main.

## Review
- In progress. The helper posts canonical `session_message` agent events directly to `/api/v1/sessions/{id}/events`, requires a non-human `--agent`, and fails before local transcript persistence if the remote grant is rejected.
- The local stream append API now accepts `syncRemote: false` for the explicit remote-first path, preserving the existing best-effort dashboard sync behavior for normal appends.
- Coordination guidance now tells granted agents to use `sl session post-agent <id> "status: <update>" --agent <your-agent-id>` so Senti shows agent-authored updates instead of human relays.
- Validation green:
  - `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.session-post-agent.test.mjs tests/unit.commands-contracts.test.mjs tests/unit.session-setup-guides.test.mjs tests/unit.session-stream.test.mjs` passed (`24/24`).
  - `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.devtestbot-runner.test.mjs tests/unit.devtestbot-tool.test.mjs tests/unit.investor-dd-orchestrator.test.mjs` passed (`20/20`) after restoring declared dependencies with `npm install`.
  - `npm run test:unit` passed (`1198/1198`).
  - `npm run check` passed (`305 files`).
  - `git diff --check` clean aside from Windows LF/CRLF warnings.
  - `npm run verify` passed: check, docs build, e2e `97/97`, coverage `1198/1198` with thresholds met, and npm pack dry-run produced `sentinelayer-cli-0.9.1.tgz`.
  - DD review scan `review-scan-full-20260503-111501.md` passed (`P1=0`, `P2=3`, blocking=false).
  - OmarGate dry-run `omargate-1777806922439-e3c74dc2` passed blocking gates (`P0=0`, `P1=0`, blocking=false; non-blocking `P2=31`, `P3=1`).

# 2026-04-28 - v0.9.0 DD Release Gap Closure (`release/v0.9.0-dd-spec`)

## Plan
- [x] Validate Claude audit findings against current `origin/main` and npm registry state.
- [x] Confirm D3 coordination etiquette already includes `sl session listen --session <id> --agent <your-name> --interval 60 --emit ndjson`; no doc code change needed for that stale audit item.
- [x] Create a fresh `origin/main` worktree and branch for the release gap.
- [x] Bump `sentinelayer-cli` package metadata and release-please manifest to `0.9.0`.
- [x] Add a `0.9.0` changelog entry covering DD PRs A1-F2 plus post-merge fixes.
- [x] Run local release-quality gates: version checks, `npm run verify`, DD review, OmarGate, and audit.
- [x] Open PR, watch CI/Omar/attestation to green, merge, and verify post-merge main.
- [x] Create/dispatch the `v0.9.0` release workflow and verify npm `latest` resolves to `0.9.0`.

## Review
- Completed. Claude's npm/latest gap was confirmed and closed: npm `sentinelayer-cli@latest` now resolves to `0.9.0`.
- Claude's D3 etiquette gap is stale on current main: `src/session/coordination-guidance.js` already instructs agents to run `sl session listen --session <id> --agent <your-name> --interval 60 --emit ndjson` and fall back to `sync/read`.
- Local validation is green:
  - Version surfaces: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `.release-please-manifest.json` all resolve to `0.9.0`; `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js --version` and `node bin/sl.js --version` return `0.9.0`.
  - `npm run verify` passed: `check` 303 files, docs build, e2e `97/97`, unit coverage `1177/1177`, and npm pack dry-run produced `sentinelayer-cli-0.9.0.tgz`.
  - DD review `review-20260428-144628-30afe299` passed clean (`P0=0 P1=0 P2=0 P3=0`).
  - OmarGate dry-run `omargate-1777387595707-70ae39d4` is non-blocking (`P0=0 P1=0`, blocking=false).
  - `/audit` `audit-20260428-144643` passed (`P1=0`, blocking=false).
  - `git diff --check` clean aside from Windows LF/CRLF warnings.
- PR/release evidence:
  - PR #448 merged as main commit `ab3d04e8f9282a065d76ac479bc3b16af07bfec4`.
  - Post-merge main workflows for `ab3d04e8` passed: Quality Gates `25060423682`, Omar Gate `25060423548`, Build Attestation `25060423546`, and Release Please `25060423572`.
  - GitHub release `v0.9.0` published at https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/releases/tag/v0.9.0.
  - Release workflow dispatch `25061144175` passed and published `sentinelayer-cli@0.9.0` directly to npm `latest`.
  - `npm view sentinelayer-cli version` returns `0.9.0`; dist-tags show `latest: 0.9.0`.

# 2026-04-28 - DD PR-F2 Orchestrator Email Trigger (`dd/pr-f2-dd-orchestrator-email`)

## Plan
- [x] Verify PR-F1 merged in `sentinelayer-api` and post-merge Omar Gate is green before starting F2.
- [x] Create a clean `create-sentinelayer` worktree from `origin/main` and align the branch name with the spec.
- [x] Read the DD F2 contract, AGENTS/SWE guidance, Senti lessons, existing `investor-dd` command registration, legacy arg bridge, orchestrator stream lifecycle, auth/session resolver, API request wrapper, and telemetry sync circuit-breaker pattern.
- [x] Add `--email-on-complete <to>` to the commander surface and legacy argument bridge for `/omargate investor-dd`.
- [x] Add a bounded, authenticated DD report email client that POSTs `/api/v1/runs/{run_id}/send-report-email` with a deterministic idempotency key and never logs tokens or local artifact paths.
- [x] Wire the investor-DD orchestrator to call the client after DD phases finish and emit `dd_email_queued` on success or redacted `dd_email_error` on failure without invalidating the DD run.
- [x] Add focused tests for command registration, legacy flag pass-through, client request/idempotency/error behavior, orchestrator stream events, and CLI dry-run/event output.
- [x] Run focused tests, `npm run check`, full `npm run verify`, DD review, local Omar, and local audit.
- [ ] Open PR, watch CI/OmarGate, merge, and verify post-merge main.

## Review
- In progress. F2 is scoped to the CLI/orchestrator trigger only; the API email endpoint was merged separately as `sentinelayer-api` PR #470 and verified green on main run `25044223824`.
- Implemented:
  - `omargate investor-dd --email-on-complete <addr>` and legacy `/omargate investor-dd` pass-through.
  - `src/review/dd-report-email-client.js` with active auth resolution, bounded API request, deterministic idempotency key, recipient validation, and token/local-path error redaction.
  - investor-DD orchestrator post-completion trigger that emits both `type` and `event` as `dd_email_queued`; failures emit redacted `dd_email_error` and never change DD run status.
  - e2e mock API verification for the streamed `dd_email_queued` event and authenticated POST to `/api/v1/runs/{run_id}/send-report-email`.
- Validation green:
  - `node --check` on changed JS modules.
  - `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.dd-report-email-client.test.mjs tests/unit.investor-dd-orchestrator.test.mjs tests/unit.legacy-args-persona-flags.test.mjs tests/unit.commands-contracts.test.mjs` (`41 passed`).
  - `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/e2e.test.mjs` (`97 passed`; includes `dd_email_queued` and email POST mock).
  - `npm run verify` (`check` 303 files, docs build, e2e 97/97, unit coverage 1177/1177, npm pack dry-run).
  - `git diff --check` clean aside from Windows LF/CRLF warnings.
  - DD review `review-20260428-093713-8d81f09a` clean (`P0=0 P1=0 P2=0 P3=0`).
  - Omar dry-run `omargate-1777369034867-ba212027` non-blocking (`P0=0 P1=0`, blocking=false).
  - `/audit` `audit-20260428-093713` PASS (`P1=0`, blocking=false).

# 2026-04-28 - Post-E3 Main Quality Gate Fix (`fix/e3-postmerge-quality-test`)

## Plan
- [x] Extract the post-merge `main` Quality Gates failure from run `25041008226`.
- [x] Identify root cause: Senti stream watchers used `replayTail: 0`, so events appended immediately after `startSenti()` could be swallowed by the watcher's initial cursor read.
- [x] Patch help/directive watchers to replay a bounded startup tail since daemon start and harden the help-response test to wait for the exact response event.
- [x] Run focused session daemon tests repeatedly, then `npm run check`, `npm run verify`, DD review, OmarGate, and audit.
- [ ] Open PR, watch PR CI/OmarGate to green, merge, and verify post-merge main.

## Review
- Root cause: `startSenti()` starts async stream watchers and returns the daemon handle immediately; with `tailStream(... replayTail: 0)`, a `help_request` appended before the watcher performed its first read could be treated as part of the initial cursor and never answered.
- Fix: both help-request and session-directive watchers now replay a bounded startup tail constrained by `since: daemonState.startedAt`, and the failing test waits for the request-specific `help_response` instead of relying on a fixed sleep.
- Focused validation passed: `node --check src/session/daemon.js`, two session daemon test files, and five consecutive focused repeats (7 tests each).
- Full local validation passed: `npm run check` (302 files), `npm run verify` after `npm ci` (docs, e2e 97/97, coverage 1170/1170, npm pack dry-run), `git diff --check` clean aside from Windows LF/CRLF warnings, DD review clean (`review-20260428-081342-a47a9856`, P0/P1/P2/P3 all zero), OmarGate dry-run non-blocking (`omargate-1777364023905-f2419cf2`, P0=0/P1=0, blocking=false), and `/audit` PASS (`audit-20260428-081342`, P1=0, P2=3 non-blocking).

# 2026-04-28 - DD PR-E2 devTestBot Persona (`dd/pr-e2-devtestbot-persona`)

## Plan
- [x] Confirm PR-E1 merged and post-merge main workflows are green, sync from `origin/main`, and create a clean PR-E2 worktree.
- [x] Run Senti `session sync` + `session read`; latest tail contains only `cli-user` self updates and duplicate relays, with no new Claude/Audit response to consume.
- [x] Read the DD PR-E2 contract, AGENTS workflow, SWE framework addendum, Jules persona patterns, AIdenID identity registry, swarm registry/runtime, and E1 devTestBot runner.
- [x] Add `src/agents/devtestbot/config/definition.js` and `system-prompt.js` with scan-only, no-data-extraction, full system test, console/network/a11y/Lighthouse/click/password-reset lane requirements.
- [x] Add `devtestbot.run_session` wrapper around the E1 runner that accepts `{ scope, identityId, baseUrl, recordVideo }`, uses local identity metadata only, redacts sensitive values, and returns normalized findings plus artifact paths.
- [x] Register `devtestbot` as a built-in swarm agent and wire `swarm run --agent devtestbot --scope smoke` through the governed runtime with artifact/findings output.
- [x] Add focused definition, prompt, tool, registry, command-contract, runtime, and CLI smoke tests.
- [x] Run focused tests, `npm run check`, full `npm run verify`, DD-spec review, local OmarGate, and audit before opening PR.
- [ ] Open PR, watch CI/OmarGate to green, merge, and verify main before PR-E3.

- `tasks/todo.md`

## Review
- In progress. This PR is scoped to making devTestBot an invokable persona/tool and swarm target only; DD auto-engagement stays in PR-E3 and email/report bundling stays in F1/F2.
- Integration decision: keep the existing `swarm run` runtime format and add a narrow `devtestbot` branch inside the assignment loop, while returning canonical agent-event envelopes for `agent_start`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `finding`, and `agent_complete` in the devTestBot result bundle.
- Safety decision: the tool resolves only local identity registry metadata by `identityId`; it never accepts or returns raw passwords, OTPs, reset links, cookies, bearer tokens, or credential material.
- Focused validation passed: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.devtestbot-definition.test.mjs tests/unit.devtestbot-system-prompt.test.mjs tests/unit.devtestbot-tool.test.mjs` (5/5), `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.swarm-registry.test.mjs tests/unit.swarm-factory.test.mjs tests/unit.swarm-runtime.test.mjs tests/unit.commands-contracts.test.mjs` (23/23), and `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/e2e.test.mjs --test-name-pattern "devTestBot|swarm registry|swarm run"` (96/96 because Node's pattern matched the broad e2e names; includes the new `swarm run --agent devtestbot --scope smoke` dry-run artifact smoke).
- Full local validation passed: `npm run check` (301 files), `npm run verify` (docs build, e2e 96/96, unit coverage 1167/1167 with thresholds met, npm pack dry-run), `git diff --check` clean aside from Windows LF/CRLF warnings, DD diff review clean (`review-20260428-065046-d0e7cc46`, P0/P1/P2/P3 all zero), local OmarGate dry-run non-blocking (`omargate-1777359062348-5d8b4420`, P0=0/P1=0, blocking=false), and `/audit --path . --json` PASS (`audit-20260428-065101`, P1=0, P2=3 non-blocking).
- CI loop 1: PR #444 failed Eval Impact because `src/commands/swarm.js`, `src/swarm/registry.js`, and `src/swarm/runtime.js` are AI-impacting files. Added `tasks/evals/pr-e2-devtestbot-persona.md` with deterministic evidence and rerunning the eval gate/checks.

# 2026-04-28 - DD PR-E1 Playwright Base (`dd/pr-e1-playwright-base`)

## Plan
- [x] Confirm PR-D3 merge and post-merge main workflows are green, sync from `origin/main`, and create a clean PR-E1 worktree.
- [x] Run Senti `session sync` + `session read`; latest tail contains only `cli-user` self updates and duplicate relays, with no Claude/Audit response to consume.
- [x] Read the DD PR-E1 contract, AGENTS workflow, CLAUDE Omar loop, SWE Excellence Core Web Vitals/QA capture guidance, current runtime-audit/browser patterns, and CI dependency install constraints.
- [x] Add exact runtime dependencies for `playwright`, `axe-core`, `@axe-core/playwright`, and Node-20-compatible `lighthouse@12.x`.
- [x] Add `src/agents/devtestbot/runner.js` with a reusable `launch({ baseUrl, identityCreds })` wrapper that captures console, network, a11y, Lighthouse, click coverage, and video-compatible artifacts.
- [x] Add focused smoke coverage against a local static fixture proving each capture lane writes an artifact.
- [x] Run focused tests, `npm run check`, DD-spec review, full verify, local OmarGate, and audit.
- [ ] Open PR, watch CI/OmarGate to green, merge, and verify main before PR-E2.

- `.github/policies/license-policy.json`
- `src/agents/devtestbot/runner.js`
- `tests/unit.devtestbot-runner.test.mjs`
- `tasks/todo.md`

## Review
- In progress. This PR is scoped to browser automation primitives only; the devTestBot persona and DD orchestrator hook remain PR-E2 and PR-E3.
- Dependency decision: latest `lighthouse@13.1.0` requires Node `>=22.19`, so this PR pins `lighthouse@12.8.2` to preserve the package's declared Node 20/22 support.
- Implemented the runner with explicit Playwright Chromium/ffmpeg preflight, sanitized console/network capture, axe scan output, Lighthouse JSON output, click coverage, native Playwright WebM, and a valid MP4 compatibility artifact generated from captured browser frames.
- Focused validation passed: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.devtestbot-runner.test.mjs` (2 tests pass, real browser smoke produced MP4, a11y JSON, Lighthouse JSON, console/network/click artifacts).
- Repo validation passed: `npm run check` (297 files), `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/e2e.test.mjs` (95 tests), `npm run test:coverage` (1159 tests, coverage thresholds met), and full `npm run verify` after the final patch.
- DD-spec `review --diff --refresh` is clean (`review-20260428-054134-567e529d`, P0/P1/P2/P3 all zero). Earlier P2 loop warning was fixed by batching image decoding before MP4 encoding.
- Production license policy check passed after allowing new permissive/transitive production licenses (`MPL-2.0`, `0BSD`, `BSD`): 242 packages, 0 failures.
- Local gates passed: `/omargate deep --ai-dry-run --max-cost 5` (`omargate-1777354778138-4a486ce8`, P0=0/P1=0, blocking=false; non-blocking baseline P2/P3 only) and `/audit --path . --json` (PASS, P1=0, P2=3 non-blocking).
- CI loop: PR #443 Quality Gates `Test` job failed once because the ffmpeg preflight accepted `ffmpeg` but Playwright's Linux payload is `ffmpeg-linux` under `ffmpeg-1011`. Patched `findPlaywrightFfmpegExecutable` with platform-specific Playwright payload names and added a regression test for the Linux CI cache layout.
- Post-CI-fix validation passed: focused devTestBot test (3/3), full `npm run verify` (`check`, docs build, 95 e2e, 1160 unit coverage tests, npm pack dry-run), DD review against `tasks/dd-build-spec-2026-04-26.md` clean (`review-20260428-055436-6c0340a0`, P0/P1/P2/P3 all zero), local OmarGate dry-run non-blocking (`omargate-1777355649749-6ffc58a4`, P0=0/P1=0), and `/audit` PASS (`audit-20260428-055349`, P1=0, P2=3 non-blocking).
- CI loop 2: PR #443 Node 22 coverage failed once in the pre-existing session daemon lock directive test because fixed sleeps did not guarantee Senti had processed the `lock:` messages before assertion. Hardened that test to poll for the exact stream events (`file_lock`, `file_lock_denied`, `file_unlock`) before asserting.
- Post-CI-loop-2 validation passed: session daemon focused test 5 consecutive runs, full `npm run test:coverage` (1160/1160), full `npm run verify`, DD review against build spec clean (`review-20260428-060402-fffc74ac`, P0/P1/P2/P3 all zero), OmarGate dry-run non-blocking (`omargate-1777356410645-501b19e0`, P0=0/P1=0), `/audit` PASS (`audit-20260428-060649`, P1=0, P2=3 non-blocking), and `git diff --check` clean aside from Windows LF/CRLF warnings.

# 2026-04-28 - DD PR-D3 Session Background Listener (`dd/pr-d3-session-listen`)

## Plan
- [x] Confirm PR-D2 merge and post-merge main workflows are green, sync from `origin/main`, and create a clean PR-D3 worktree.
- [x] Run Senti `session sync` + `session read`; latest tail contains only `cli-user` self updates and duplicate relays, with no Claude/Audit response to consume.
- [x] Read the DD PR-D3 contract, AGENTS workflow, SWE framework, existing session sync/cursor primitives, command registration, and coordination guidance.
- [x] Add a small session listener module that loops on `/api/v1/sessions/{id}/events`, reuses `pollSessionEvents`, persists a listen-specific cursor, and filters direct/broadcast events by agent id.
- [x] Add `sl session listen --session <id> --interval 60 --emit ndjson` plus agent/path/limit/replay/test-bounded controls.
- [x] Add `sl session say --to <agent>` so agents can send direct D3-addressed messages through the existing session event spine.
- [x] Update canonical coordination etiquette to prefer the background listener and keep `sync`/`read` as fallback.
- [x] Add focused listener, command-contract, sync URL/circuit, and guidance tests.
- [x] Run focused tests, `npm run check`, DD-spec review, full verify, local OmarGate, and audit.
- [x] Open PR, watch CI/OmarGate to green, merge, and verify main before PR-E1.

## Review
- In progress. This PR is scoped to D3 agent-facing background polling and direct-message addressing only; Playwright/devTestBot work starts in PR-E1.
- Implemented `src/session/listener.js` with listen-specific cursors, first-poll priming, timestamp-aware race protection for new first-poll events, broadcast/direct recipient filtering, and injectable poll/sleep/cursor seams.
- Added `session listen --session <id> --agent <id> --interval 60 --emit ndjson` and `session say --to <agent>`.
- Focused validation passed:
  - `node --check src\session\listener.js src\commands\session.js src\session\coordination-guidance.js`

  - `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/e2e.test.mjs` (95 tests pass)
  - `npm run check` (296 files) and `git diff --check` (clean; Windows line-ending warnings only)
  - First `npm run verify` reached coverage and stopped because `c8` was absent in this worktree; ran `npm ci` to restore dev dependencies.
  - Fixed coverage-runner shared-state flake by resetting sync circuit state at the end of breaker tests and at the start of API-url allowlist tests.
  - `npm run test:coverage` passed (1157 unit tests; statements 90.26%, branches 70.54%).
  - `npm run verify` passed end to end: check, docs build, 95 e2e tests, 1157 unit coverage tests, and npm pack dry-run.
  - DD diff review passed clean: `review --diff --refresh --spec tasks/dd-build-spec-2026-04-26.md --json` (`review-20260428-044352-c9ee6cbc`, P0/P1/P2/P3 all zero).
  - Live listener smoke passed against Senti session `d42cc584-1ee9-494b-b2d6-220c8525fde7`: one process ran `session listen --session ... --agent codex-d3-smoke2 --interval 1 --emit ndjson --max-polls 10`, another sent `session say --to codex-d3-smoke2`; listener printed the direct `session_message` NDJSON with cursor `1777351471780:0a9ae6dd`.
  - Local OmarGate passed: `/omargate deep --ai-dry-run --max-cost 5` (`omargate-1777351511227-2c593d24`, P0=0/P1=0, blocking=false; non-blocking baseline P2/P3 only).
  - Local `/audit --path . --json` passed (`overallStatus=PASS`, P1=0, P2=3 non-blocking).

# 2026-04-28 - DD PR-D2 Session Auto-Name + Resume (`dd/pr-d2-session-auto-name-resume`)

## Plan
- [x] Validate current main against PR-D2 spec and confirm partial implementation gaps.
- [x] Post D2 scope, gaps, and file claims to Senti session `d42cc584-1ee9-494b-b2d6-220c8525fde7`.
- [x] Persist session titles locally and include them in metadata sync so resumed sessions keep a stable name.
- [x] Make local auto-resume use recent activity (`lastInteractionAt`) as well as creation time, with robust same-workspace matching.
- [x] Add real `--resume` default-true / `--no-resume` behavior while preserving `--force-new`.
- [x] Add `sl session ensure --path .` returning canonical `{ sessionId, title, resumed }`.
- [x] Add focused unit coverage for start/ensure title, same-window reuse, outside-window new session, and command contracts.
- [x] Run focused tests, `npm run check`, DD-spec review, full verify, OmarGate, and audit.
- [x] Open PR, watch CI/OmarGate to green, merge, and verify main before PR-D3.

- `src/session/store.js`
- `tests/unit.session-ensure.test.mjs`
- `tests/unit.commands-contracts.test.mjs`
- `tasks/todo.md`

## Review
- In progress. This PR is scoped to D2 runtime session ensure/resume/title behavior only; D3 background polling stays out of this branch.
- Implemented local title persistence in session metadata, including title fields in start payloads and metadata sync.
- Added activity-aware resume selection using `lastInteractionAt`/`lastActivityAt`, path-normalized remote matching, and a test guard so unit runs do not hit the live remote registry.
- Added explicit `--resume` / `--no-resume` controls and the JSON-first `session ensure` command.
- Focused validation passed:

- Local gates passed: `/omargate deep --ai-dry-run --max-cost 5` (`omargate-1777348705361-6336797c`, P0=0/P1=0, non-blocking baseline P2/P3 only) and `/audit --path . --json` (PASS, P1=0, P2=3 non-blocking).

# 2026-04-28 - D1 Post-Merge Main Unblock (`fix/d1-postmerge-scope-abort-race`)

## Plan
- [x] Identify direct post-merge main failure before starting PR-D2.
- [x] Pull CI logs for `Quality Gates` run `25031586422`, job `Unit Coverage (>=80%, Node 22)`.
- [x] Fix the Node 22 abort-race test harness so the expected rejection is attached before `session kill` triggers cancellation.
- [x] Fix the session daemon context-relay test to wait for the paired `help_response` and `model_span` events instead of relying on a fixed sleep.
- [x] Run focused tests, repo gates, review/Omar/audit as needed.
- [ ] Open PR, merge, and re-run main workflows green.

## File Claims
- `tests/unit.triage-scope-engine.test.mjs`
- `tests/unit.session-daemon-context.test.mjs`
- `tasks/todo.md`

## Review
- Root cause: `buildPromise` could reject during `session kill` before the test attached `assert.rejects`, which Node 22 surfaced as an `unhandledRejection`.
- Fix: attach the expected abort rejection immediately after confirming the scope-engine run is active, then await it after validating the kill command output.
- Additional local flake found during coverage stress: session daemon context relay could read the stream after `help_response` but before `model_span`; fixed with a bounded event-based wait scoped to request id.
- This is a test-ordering fix only; `src/daemon/scope-engine.js` cancellation behavior is unchanged.
- Focused validation passed:
  - `node --test --test-name-pattern "session kill --agent scope-engine aborts active run and emits agent_killed" tests/unit.triage-scope-engine.test.mjs`
  - `node --test tests/unit.session-daemon-context.test.mjs`
- Repo validation passed: `npm run verify` (check, docs build, 95 e2e, 1142 unit coverage tests, pack dry-run), `git diff --check`, DD-spec `review --diff --refresh` (`review-20260428-031757-52008bf1`, P0/P1/P2/P3 all zero), `/audit` PASS (559 files, P1=0, P2=3 non-blocking), and local `/omargate deep --ai-dry-run --max-cost 5` (`omargate-1777346279029-2b5ac57c`, P0=0/P1=0, baseline non-blocking P2/P3 only).

# 2026-04-28 - DD PR-D1 Coordination Autoinject (`dd/pr-d1-coordination-autoinject`)

## Plan
- [x] Confirm PR-C3 merge and post-merge main workflows are green, sync from `origin/main`, and create a clean PR-D1 worktree.
- [x] Run Senti `session sync` + `session read`; latest tail contains no non-self Claude/Audit messages.
- [x] Read the DD PR-D1 contract, AGENTS workflow, SWE framework, current spec/prompt/guide generators, session setup guide injection, and coordination tests.
- [x] Add one pure canonical coordination-etiquette helper so spec, prompt, guide exports, AGENTS.md setup, and generated session guide text share the same rules.
- [x] Make spec generation include the coordination phase by default when session tooling is available, with an explicit test-only opt-out for no-session-tool contexts.
- [x] Make prompt generation always include coordination operating rules, independent of whether the source spec already mentions sessions.
- [x] Make build-guide markdown plus Jira/Linear/GitHub issue exports include coordination rules.
- [x] Refresh focused unit/e2e coverage proving `sl spec generate`, `sl prompt generate`, and `sl guide generate/export` carry the coordination block.
- [x] Run focused tests, `npm run check`, DD-spec review, full verify, and local OmarGate/audit gates.
- [ ] Push PR, watch CI, merge, and verify main before PR-D2.

- `tasks/lessons.md`

## Review
- In progress. Implementation is isolated in clean worktree `create-sentinelayer-pr176-c3-clean` so unrelated session auto-name/resume dirty work in the original worktree does not contaminate this PR.
- Borrowed the 11-lens evidence contract shape into OmarGate prompt code directly rather than importing Jules modules.
- Wired OmarGate persona-specific prompts into dry-run/live AI review calls for both single persona execution and swarm subagents.
- Routed prompt artifacts to `.sentinelayer/reviews/<run>/personas/<persona>/REVIEW_AI_PROMPT.txt` and `.sentinelayer/reviews/<run>/swarm/<persona>/subagent-N/REVIEW_AI_PROMPT.txt`.
- Extended AI parsing/reconciliation to keep evidence contract fields through final reports.

- False-positive guard measurement recorded in `tasks/evals/pr-c3-eleven-lens-omargate.md`: baseline `origin/main` prompt coverage was 0/13 personas with `lensEvidence`; PR-C3 prompt tests prove 13/13 persona prompt coverage, and local OmarGate dry-run proved generated prompt artifacts plus reconciled evidence fields.
- Post-rebase validation on `origin/main` `6790450` passed:
  - Focused syntax/tests: persona prompts, AI parser, OmarGate orchestrator, and report reconciliation passed 24/24 focused tests.
  - `npm run check` passed (294 files) and `git diff --check` passed.
  - `review --diff --refresh --spec tasks/dd-build-spec-2026-04-26.md --json` was clean but scoped to 0 files because the PR changes are committed; verified PR diff separately with 11 changed files.
  - Full deterministic spec review (`review --spec tasks/dd-build-spec-2026-04-26.md --refresh --json`) scanned 556 files with P0=0/P1=0 and only non-blocking baseline P2 findings.
  - `npm run verify` passed: check, docs build, 95 e2e tests, 1140 unit coverage tests, and npm pack dry-run.

## Review
- Implemented shared OmarGate deterministic cache helper in `src/review/omargate-cache.js` with stable run paths, latest index resolution, target-path matching, invalid run id protection, and fail-closed missing/malformed behavior.
- Wired `/omargate deep` to write `.sentinelayer/runs/<runId>/deterministic.json` after report generation and expose the OmarGate run id/cache path in JSON output.
- Wired modern `audit --reuse-omargate <runId|latest>` to load cached deterministic findings, skip deterministic rerun when valid, seed the audit blackboard from `source=omargate-reuse`, and show the reused OmarGate run in report metadata.
- Wired legacy slash `/audit --reuse-omargate <runId|latest>` so the spec's `sl /audit --path . --reuse-omargate latest` sequence reuses the latest OmarGate deterministic cache and reports the prior run id.

## Review
- Implemented confidence floor enforcement in `src/review/report.js` after reconciliation merge/dedupe and before sorting/ID assignment.
- Preserved public `sources` while adding internal `confirmationSources` so deterministic+AI and two distinct AI personas count as multi-source confirmations; duplicate reports from one persona still count as single-source.
- Preserved persona/layer/floor metadata and surfaced dropped low-confidence single-source counts in JSON summary and markdown.
- Wired OmarGate persona findings to carry effective confidence floors and reconciliation metadata for `droppedBelowConfidence` / `droppedLowConfidence`.

# 2026-04-28 - DD PR-B2 Audit Persona Swarm Fanout (`dd/pr-b2-audit-swarm`)

## Plan
- [x] Confirm PR-B1 post-merge main workflows are green and branch from current `main`.
- [x] Poll/post Senti session `d42cc584-1ee9-494b-b2d6-220c8525fde7` before starting B2.
- [x] Read the DD spec B2 contract, repo AGENTS workflow, SWE framework, audit persona loop, audit orchestrator, and PR-B1 swarm implementation.
- [x] Add audit persona swarm decision, file partitioning, and budget slicing using the Jules/PR-B1 thresholds: >15 files, >=3 route groups, >5000 LOC, <=12 files/subagent, <=4 concurrent subagents.
- [x] Route oversized non-Jules `/audit` persona scopes through isolated subagent persona loops with parent-bound budgets.
- [x] Emit `swarm_start`/`swarm_complete` and per-subagent `agent_start`/terminal lifecycle events carrying persona id, subagent index, scope, and usage.
- [x] Roll subagent findings and usage back into the existing audit persona result so orchestration reconciliation/dedupe remains centralized.
- [x] Add focused unit and CLI stream fixture coverage proving `sl audit --stream` emits swarm lifecycle on a >15-file, >5000-LOC fixture.
- [ ] Run targeted tests, `npm run check`, DD-spec-bound `review --diff`, `npm run verify`, local `/omargate deep`, local `/audit`, `git diff --check`, then PR/CI/merge.

## File Claims
- `src/audit/persona-loop.js`
- `src/audit/orchestrator.js` only if the persona loop needs real ingest scope handoff
- `tests/unit.audit-persona-loop.test.mjs`
- `tests/e2e.test.mjs`
- `tasks/todo.md`
- `tasks/lessons.md`
- Optional only if cleaner than duplication: a shared swarm scope helper used by audit and OmarGate

## Review
- Implemented audit persona swarm fanout in `src/audit/persona-loop.js`:
  - `buildAuditPersonaFileScope()`, `decideAuditPersonaSwarm()`, `partitionAuditPersonaFiles()`, and `divideAuditSwarmBudget()` mirror PR-B1/Jules thresholds without importing OmarGate internals.
  - Oversized persona scopes derive from `ingest.indexedFiles.files`, split into <=12-file partitions, run with <=4 inner concurrency, and split the persona budget across subagents.
  - Subagent persona loops receive assigned file prompts, filtered seed/baseline findings, isolated run ids, and event context.
  - Stream events now include parent `swarm_start`/`swarm_complete` plus per-subagent lifecycle events with persona id, partition, file scope, and usage.
- Added `swarm` metadata to audit orchestrator agent result artifacts.
- Validation so far:
  - `node --check src/audit/persona-loop.js; node --check src/audit/orchestrator.js` (pass)
  - `node --test tests/unit.audit-persona-loop.test.mjs` (7 tests pass)
  - `node --test --test-name-pattern "audit --stream emits swarm lifecycle" tests/e2e.test.mjs` (pass)
  - `npm run check` (293 files pass)
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js review --diff --spec tasks/dd-build-spec-2026-04-26.md --json` (P0=0 P1=0 P2=0 P3=0; run `review-20260428-001800-a192e2f0`)
  - `npm run verify` (pass: check, docs build, 94 e2e, 1117 unit coverage tests, pack dry-run)
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js audit --path . --agents security --dry-run --stream` (pass; emitted `swarm_start`, `security-subagent-*` lifecycle, and `swarm_complete`)
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js /omargate deep --path . --json --ai-dry-run --max-cost 5` (pass: P0=0 P1=0, blocking=false)
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js /audit --path . --json` (pass: overallStatus=PASS, P1=0, blocking=false)
  - `git diff --check` (pass)

# 2026-04-27 - DD PR-B1 OmarGate Swarm Fanout (`dd/pr-b1-omargate-swarm`)

## Plan
- [x] Sync `main`, create branch, and read the DD spec, AGENTS workflow, SWE excellence framework, OmarGate orchestrator, and Jules swarm primitives.
- [x] Post PR-B1 start/status to active Senti session `d42cc584-1ee9-494b-b2d6-220c8525fde7`.
- [x] Add OmarGate-local swarm decision and file partition helpers using the Jules thresholds: >15 files, >=3 route groups, >5000 LOC, <=12 files/subagent, <=4 concurrent subagents.
- [x] Route oversized persona scopes through subagent-scoped `runAiReviewLayer` calls with parent-bound cost slices and isolated run/session ids.
- [x] Emit `swarm_start`/`swarm_complete` plus per-subagent `agent_start`/`agent_complete` events carrying persona id, subagent index, scope, and usage.
- [x] Roll subagent findings into the existing persona result and keep final reconciliation/dedupe centralized in `reconcileReviewFindings`.
- [x] Add deterministic unit/e2e coverage with a >15 file and >5000 LOC fixture proving `sl /omargate deep --stream` emits swarm lifecycle and respects per-persona budget.
- [x] Run targeted tests, `npm run check`, DD-spec-bound `review --diff`, `npm run verify`, local `/omargate deep`, `git diff --check`, then PR/CI/merge.

## File Claims
- `src/review/omargate-orchestrator.js`
- `src/legacy-cli.js` (deterministic scope handoff only)
- `src/commands/legacy-args.js` (OmarGate option pass-through needed for stream/dry-run proof)
- `src/cost/history.js` (in-process append serialization for concurrent swarm AI calls)
- `tests/unit.omargate-orchestrator.test.mjs` (new if no existing focused unit file fits)
- `tests/unit.legacy-args-persona-flags.test.mjs`
- `tests/unit.cost-history.test.mjs`
- `tests/e2e.test.mjs` only if CLI stream proof needs integration coverage
- `tasks/todo.md`

## Review
- Implemented OmarGate-local swarm fanout in `src/review/omargate-orchestrator.js`:
  - `decideSwarm({ scope })`, `partitionFiles()`, and `divideSwarmBudget()` mirror Jules thresholds without importing the frontend/Jules-specific swarm runtime.
  - Oversized persona scopes fan out into scoped `runAiReviewLayer` subagent calls with isolated run/session ids and per-subagent cost slices.
  - Stream now emits `swarm_start`, per-subagent `agent_start`/`agent_complete` or `agent_error`, `swarm_complete`, and the existing persona/omargate lifecycle.
  - Subagent findings roll back into the existing persona result and final `reconcileReviewFindings()` path.
- Added CLI bridge pass-through in `src/commands/legacy-args.js` so `omargate deep` Commander options (`--stream`, `--ai-dry-run`, `--max-cost`, `--scan-mode`, model/provider, etc.) reach the legacy implementation.
- Passed deterministic scope/layer/artifact metadata from `src/legacy-cli.js` into OmarGate so the swarm decision uses the actual deterministic scan scope.
- Fixed shared cost-history concurrency for fanout by serializing in-process `appendCostEntry()` writes in `src/cost/history.js`; added a 24-way concurrent append regression.
- Validation:
  - `node --test tests/unit.omargate-orchestrator.test.mjs tests/unit.legacy-args-persona-flags.test.mjs` (15 tests pass)
  - `node --test tests/unit.cost-history.test.mjs tests/unit.omargate-orchestrator.test.mjs tests/unit.legacy-args-persona-flags.test.mjs` (20 tests pass)
  - `node --test --test-name-pattern "omargate deep --stream emits swarm" tests/e2e.test.mjs` (pass)
  - `npm run check` (293 files pass)
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js review --diff --spec tasks/dd-build-spec-2026-04-26.md --json` (P0=0 P1=0 P2=0 P3=0; run `review-20260427-234815-6ef4bc11`)
  - `npm run verify` (pass: check, docs build, 93 e2e, 1115 unit coverage tests, pack dry-run)
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js /omargate deep --path . --json --ai-dry-run --max-cost 5` (pass: P0=0 P1=0, blocking=false; all 13 personas ok after cost-history race fix)
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js /audit --path . --json` (pass: overallStatus=PASS, P1=0, blocking=false)
  - `git diff --check` (pass)

# 2026-04-27 - DD PR-A3 Reconciliation Typed Events (`dd/pr-a3-reconcile-events`)

## Plan
- [x] Sync `main`, create branch, and read the DD spec plus current audit event surfaces.
- [x] Post the active Senti coordination link and web hotfix status.
- [x] Add first-class audit lifecycle event names to the canonical event schema/list without breaking legacy event compatibility.
- [x] Emit typed `orchestrator_*`, `phase_*`, `dispatch`, and `reconcile_*` events from the modern audit orchestrator while keeping `progress` shadow events for one release.
- [x] Update stream tests to assert the typed lifecycle contract and backward-compatible progress shadows.
- [x] Run targeted tests, `npm run verify`, local review, local Omar, and live stream proof before opening PR.
- [ ] Open PR, watch GitHub Omar/Quality/Attestation checks, merge after green, and post results to Senti.

## Review
- Added `AGENT_EVENT_TYPES` to `src/events/schema.js` and reused it from `src/agents/jules/stream.js` so lifecycle event names are first-class without making legacy/unknown event normalization breaking.
- Updated `runAuditOrchestrator()` to emit typed lifecycle events for orchestrator start, ingest phase, deterministic baseline phase, persona dispatch, reconciliation, and orchestrator completion.
- Preserved backward compatibility by emitting `progress` shadow events with `payload.shadowFor` for every new typed lifecycle event.
- Added e2e stream assertions for the typed audit lifecycle and unit assertions for the schema/stream event type list.
- Validation:
  - `node --check src/audit/orchestrator.js` (pass)
  - `node --test tests/unit.events-schema.test.mjs tests/unit.jules-stream.test.mjs` (20 tests pass)
  - `node --test --test-name-pattern "CLI audit stream emits" tests/e2e.test.mjs` (pass)
  - `npm run check` (293 files pass)
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js review --diff --spec tasks/dd-build-spec-2026-04-26.md --json` (P0=0 P1=0 P2=0 P3=0; run `review-20260427-231019-40ffa868`)
  - `npm run verify` (pass: check, docs build, 92 e2e, 1104 unit coverage tests, pack dry-run)
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js /omargate deep --path . --json` (P0=0 P1=0, blocking=false; P2=31 deterministic advisories, AI proxy 401s nonblocking under local token)
  - `git diff --check` (pass)
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js audit --path . --agents security --dry-run --stream` (pass; emitted typed lifecycle events and `progress` shadows)

# 2026-04-27 - DD PR-A2 Persona Isolation Hardening (`dd/pr-a2-persona-isolation`)

## Plan
- [x] Sync Senti before starting and read Claude's audit notes.
- [x] Branch from current `main` as `dd/pr-a2-persona-isolation`.
- [x] Review PR-A2 requirements and current `/audit` persona loop/orchestrator wiring.
- [x] Add explicit isolated persona context construction in `src/audit/persona-loop.js`.
- [x] Add `audit --isolation strict|relaxed` and deterministic seed controls so strict isolation tests can opt out of seed bias.
- [x] Add focused tests proving message-history/context references are not shared and seed controls work.
- [x] Run local validation: targeted audit tests, `npm run check`, `/review --diff`, and PR gates as applicable.

## Review
- Implemented `createIsolatedPersonaContext()` and refactored the persona loop to use fresh per-persona message history, client, blackboard, event emitter, agent context, and tool dispatcher.
- Added `/audit --isolation strict|relaxed` with default `strict`, plus `--no-seed-from-deterministic` to prevent deterministic baseline/specialist findings from seeding persona prompts or shared blackboard context during isolation checks.
- Added unit/e2e coverage for non-shared message histories, isolation/seed metadata, and strict no-seed stream mode.
- Stabilized the unrelated session recap unit fixture after full `npm run verify` exposed a coverage-timeout interval race.
- Validation: syntax checks pass; `node --test tests/unit.audit-persona-loop.test.mjs` pass (5 tests); `node --test tests/unit.session-recap.test.mjs` pass (3 tests); `node --test --test-name-pattern "CLI audit" tests/e2e.test.mjs` pass (11 tests); `npm run verify` pass; `review --diff --json` pass with P0/P1/P2/P3 all zero; `git diff --check` pass.

# 2026-04-26 - Release Please PR-Only Mode (`ci/release-please-skip-github-release`)

## Plan
- [x] Reproduce the post-PR #429 Release Please failure on main.
- [x] Confirm Release Please still attempts to backfill merged PR #320 by creating the missing `v0.8.0` GitHub release.
- [x] Configure Release Please to skip GitHub release creation so release artifacts remain owned by the current tag-driven release flow.
- [x] Run local validation and review diff.
- [ ] Open PR, watch Omar/Quality/Attestation, merge after green.
- [ ] Confirm post-merge Release Please succeeds.

## Review
- Root cause:
  - Release Please keeps selecting merged PR #320 and trying to create the missing historical `v0.8.0` GitHub release.
  - Current release artifacts are already owned by tag-driven/manual release PRs through `v0.8.11`, so backfilling `v0.8.0` is not part of the active flow.
- Validation evidence:
  - release-please workflow YAML parse (pass)
  - `npm run check` (pass; 293 files)
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js review --diff --json` (pass; `p0=0`, `p1=0`, `p2=0`, `blocking=false`)

# 2026-04-26 - Release Please Manifest Sync (`ci/release-please-manifest-sync`)

## Plan
- [x] Reproduce the post-merge Release Please failure on main after PR-A1 merge.
- [x] Identify why Release Please attempted the stale `v0.8.0` release.
- [x] Sync `.release-please-manifest.json` and `package-lock.json` with current package/tag version `0.8.11`.
- [x] Run local validation and review diff.
- [ ] Open PR, watch Omar/Quality/Attestation, merge after green.
- [ ] Confirm post-merge Release Please no longer attempts the stale release.

## Review
- Release Please failure root cause:
  - `.release-please-manifest.json` stayed at `0.8.0`, while `package.json`, git tags, and latest GitHub release are at `0.8.11`.
  - `package-lock.json` also lagged at `0.8.7`; synced both lockfile version fields to `0.8.11`.
- Validation evidence:
  - `node -e` metadata alignment check (pass; package, package-lock root, package-lock package root, and manifest all `0.8.11`)
  - `npm run check` (pass; 293 files)
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js review --diff --json` (pass; `p0=0`, `p1=0`, `p2=0`, `blocking=false`)

# 2026-04-26 - DD Build Spec PR-A1 Persona Jules-Parity Tool Grant (`dd/pr-a1-persona-jules-tools`)

## Plan
- [x] Read `tasks/dd-build-spec-2026-04-26.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and relevant lessons before implementation.
- [x] Branch from current `main` as `dd/pr-a1-persona-jules-tools`.
- [x] Start Senti coordination session `create-sentinelayer-2026-04-26`.
- [x] Post PR-A1 plan and file claims into the Senti session.
- [x] Map existing `/audit` persona execution, Jules loop/tool dispatch, stream schema, and current tests.
- [x] Add per-persona tool grants in `src/audit/registry.js`.
- [x] Add `src/audit/persona-loop.js` with isolated non-Jules agentic execution, bounded turns, tool events, and token usage.
- [x] Wire `src/audit/orchestrator.js` to use the new loop for non-Jules personas while preserving Jules.
- [x] Add focused tests proving non-Jules personas emit tool calls, findings, and output token usage.
- [x] Run targeted tests, `npm run verify`, `/omargate deep`, and `/audit`.

## File Claims
- `src/audit/registry.js`
- `src/audit/orchestrator.js`
- `src/audit/persona-loop.js`
- `tests/*audit*`
- `tasks/todo.md`

## Review
- Completed PR-A1 local implementation on branch `dd/pr-a1-persona-jules-tools`.
- Changed:
  - `src/audit/registry.js`: canonical default audit persona tool grants (`FileRead`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Shell`, `FileEdit`) plus alias normalization.
  - `src/audit/persona-loop.js`: audit-owned non-Jules agentic loop with bounded turns, shared tool dispatch, `agent_start`/`tool_call`/`tool_result`/`agent_complete` events, and output token accounting.
  - `src/audit/orchestrator.js`: non-frontend personas now run through the agentic loop while preserving existing specialist report artifacts as seed/fallback evidence.
  - `src/commands/audit.js`: `audit --stream` emits NDJSON persona events.
  - Tests for registry grants, persona-loop tool/findings/token behavior, and `audit --stream`.

  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js audit --path . --agents security --stream` (pass; emitted `agent_start`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `agent_complete`, `usage.outputTokens=64`)
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js /omargate deep --path . --json` (pass; `p0=0`, `p1=0`, `p2=32`, `blocking=false`; AI persona proxy calls were non-blocking 401s under the trusted local test token)
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js /audit --path . --json` (pass; `overallStatus=PASS`, `p1Total=0`, `p2Total=3`, `blocking=false`)
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js review --diff --json` (pass; `p0=0`, `p1=0`, `p2=0`, `blocking=false`)

  - Posted plan, file claims, and progress updates.
- CI follow-up:
  - Added `tasks/evals/2026-04-26-pr-a1-persona-jules-tools.md` after GitHub Quality Gates required eval evidence for the AI-impacting `src/commands/audit.js` stream change.

# PR13 Cross-Repo Closure + CLI 0.8.1 Patch (2026-04-18)

# 2026-04-16 - Coverage Flake Stabilization (AIdenID/AuthAudit)

## Plan
- [x] Reproduce `npm run verify` failure under aggregate coverage run and isolate deterministic root causes.
- [x] Prevent AIdenID unit tests from leaking into host auth/session state by adding explicit session auto-resolution control.
- [x] Eliminate AuthAudit late-rejection async leakage in AIdenID retry timeout race path.
- [x] Re-run targeted unit suites, full `npm run verify`, `/omargate deep`, and `/audit`.

## Review
- Completed.
- Updated:
  - `src/ai/aidenid.js`: added `autoResolveSession` control to credential/session context resolution.
  - `tests/unit.ai-aidenid.test.mjs`: fixed determinism by setting `autoResolveSession: false` in env-only credential tests.
  - `src/agents/jules/tools/auth-audit.js`: hardened timeout race cleanup to swallow `finally()` chain rejection and prevent post-test `unhandledRejection`.
- Validation:
  - `node --test tests/unit.ai-aidenid.test.mjs`
  - `node --test tests/unit.jules-auth-audit.test.mjs`
  - `npm run verify`
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js /omargate deep --path . --json` (`p0=0`, `p1=0`, `blocking=false`)
  - `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js /audit --path . --json` (`overallStatus=PASS`, `p1=0`)

# 2026-04-14 - Omar Gate Parity Alignment (CLI vs v1 Action)

## Plan
- [x] Compare `create-sentinelayer` local Omar/scan contracts with `sentinelayer-v1-action` bridge contract (`scan_mode`, action ref pinning, trigger/status path model).
- [x] Align generated Omar workflow inputs/options to v1 action-supported scan modes.
- [x] Align legacy fallback Omar workflow template to pinned v1 action ref and same scan mode contract.
- [x] Add parity regression tests and rerun local checks/e2e slices.

## Review
- Completed.
- Updated:
  - `src/scan/generator.js`: `scan_mode` workflow-dispatch options now match v1 action (`baseline`, `deep`, `audit`, `full-depth`).
  - `src/review/scan-modes.js`: local `audit` mode now aliases `full-depth` persona set for command parity.
  - `src/legacy-cli.js`: handoff prompt workflow tuning text updated; fallback workflow now uses parity scan-mode options + pinned action ref `mrrCarter/sentinelayer-v1-action@55a2c158f637d7d92e26ab0ef3ba81db791da4be`.
  - `README.md`: added explicit parity note + local-vs-managed Omar execution boundary clarification.
  - `tests/unit.scan-parity.test.mjs`: added contract regression tests for scan-mode options/pinned action ref, exact baseline/deep/full-depth persona contracts, and `audit` alias equivalence.
  - `tests/e2e.test.mjs`: updated handoff prompt assertion for revised scan_mode contract line.
- Validation:
  - `npm run check`
  - `node --test tests/unit.scan-parity.test.mjs`
  - `node --test --test-name-pattern "generates artifacts and injects secret via gh|scan init targets omar-gate workflow" tests/e2e.test.mjs`
  - `node --test --test-name-pattern "scan validate detects workflow drift" tests/e2e.test.mjs`

# 2026-04-13 - Windows Auth Command Compatibility + Hint Hardening

## Plan
- [x] Add a platform-aware CLI command hint helper so runtime auth guidance does not point PowerShell users to `sl` (Set-Location alias collision).
- [x] Wire runtime auth/error hints to use the helper (`auth`, auth-gate, watch, scan setup-secrets, AIdenID/proxy paths).
- [x] Add stable non-colliding npm bin aliases (`slc`, `sl-cli`) while keeping existing command names.
- [x] Add unit coverage for command hint resolution and update docs with explicit PowerShell guidance.
- [x] Run local verification (`npm run check`, targeted unit tests, `npm run verify`).
- [ ] Open PR, run Omar Gate watch loop, and merge only after Omar pass.

## Review
- Added `src/ui/command-hints.js` and switched runtime auth hints to platform-safe command text (`sentinelayer-cli` on Windows, `sl` elsewhere).
- Updated runtime guidance surfaces in `auth`, auth gate, watch run-events, scan setup-secrets, AIdenID credential resolver, proxy auth error, and interactive equivalent-command output.
- Added npm bin aliases: `slc`, `sl-cli`.
- Added unit coverage in `tests/unit.command-hints.test.mjs`.
- Validation:
  - `npm run check`
  - `node --test tests/unit.command-hints.test.mjs`
  - `npm run verify` (passes after `npm install` in fresh clone)

# 2026-04-13 - PR-283 Omar + Quality Unblock Batch 2

## Plan
- [x] Repair `.github/workflows/attestations.yml` YAML integrity so push runs do not fail at parse time.
- [x] Restore e2e auth harness compatibility with guarded auth gate (`npm test` in CI must pass).
- [x] Tighten guarded auth bypass controls (single-use nonce + command scope + executable scope).
- [x] Add session metadata write durability barriers (temp fsync + directory sync best-effort).
- [x] Address current Omar P2 workflow findings across quality/release/attestation gates in one commit batch.
- [ ] Run local verification (`npm run check`, targeted tests, full `npm test`), push branch, approve/wait Omar Gate and Quality Gates.

## Review
- [ ] Pending.

# 2026-04-12 - Fix Omar Gate LLM Disabled (Workflow/Input Contract)

## Plan
- [x] Confirm Omar Gate runs are using the legacy v1 action that respects `sentinelayer_managed_llm` and `openai_api_key`.
- [x] Update the local Omar wrapper to enable managed LLM (`sentinelayer_managed_llm: "true"`) so runs do not skip LLM when BYOK is absent/invalid.
- [x] Verify the workflow still declares `permissions: id-token: write` for managed proxy OIDC.
- [ ] Finish P2 fixes from latest Omar Gate run (request-id continuity, remove auto idempotency, keytar determinism, workflow guardrails).
- [ ] Run targeted tests for auth/service + auth/http to confirm behavior.
- [ ] Commit and push updates to `hardening/cli-omar-only-ci`.
- [ ] Approve Omar Gate environment, run `gh run watch`, and iterate until P0-P2 clear.

## Review
- [ ] Pending.

# Sentinelayer CLI Full E2E Demo Validation (2026-04-10)

## Plan
- [x] Build and execute a 30+ command E2E runbook using only shipped CLI command surfaces (`node bin/sl.js`). (Executed 67 commands; 56 success, 11 failure.)
- [x] Run full auth flow (`auth login/status/sessions`) and validate AIdenID command paths in execute mode where credentials allow. (Auth login timed out and workspace token was invalid; execute-mode AIdenID failed due missing creds, dry-run paths passed.)
- [x] Create a net-new demo codebase from generated spec/prompt artifacts and implement strictly against generated spec (not ad-hoc design).
- [x] Use local PR-style batch loop: code batch -> `review scan` -> local Omar (`/omargate`) -> fix P0/P1 -> re-run -> local merge.
- [x] Run frontend audit and full audit command paths and capture stream + JSON artifacts.
- [x] Validate command behavior coverage (worked / failed / partial) and document defects with repro commands.
- [x] Produce a single markdown report with receipts, outputs, and go-forward recommendations.

## Review
- Completed. Report: `tasks/e2e-demo-2026-04-10/SENTINELAYER_CLI_E2E_REPORT_2026-04-10.md`.

# Permanent Auth Resolution Hardening (2026-04-10)

## Plan
- [x] Remove stored-session-only auth gate behavior and resolve active auth from `env -> config -> session`.
- [x] Harden AIdenID credential resolution to auto-resolve active SentinelLayer auth and lazy-fetch creds without local session dependency.
- [x] Replace remaining stored-session-only token paths in CLI runtime surfaces (`scan setup-secrets`, LLM proxy, runtime scanner API, telemetry sync).
- [x] Add regression test coverage for env-token auth-gate acceptance.
- [x] Run full verification (`npm run verify`) after changes.

## Review
- Completed. Active-auth fallback now works without a local session file.
- Updated files: `src/auth/gate.js`, `src/ai/aidenid.js`, `src/commands/scan.js`, `src/ai/proxy.js`, `src/agents/jules/tools/runtime-audit.js`, `src/telemetry/sync.js`, `tests/unit.auth-gate.test.mjs`.
- Verification evidence: `npm run verify` passed (89 e2e + 410 unit tests, coverage and pack checks successful).

# CLI API Token Scope Alignment (2026-04-12)

## Plan
- [x] Issue CLI API tokens with scope `cli` (not `github_app_bridge`) to match general CLI usage.
- [x] Align with sentinelayer-api guard changes to accept CLI tokens for `/auth/me`.

## Review
- Completed in `src/auth/service.js` (scope set to `cli`).

# Sentinelayer CLI Roadmap PR Preparation (2026-03-31)

## Mission
Execute `SENTINELAYER_CLI_ROADMAP.md` as secure, merge-safe PR batches using `SWE_excellence_framework.md` gates and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` autonomous loop discipline.

## Execution Board (2026-04-10: Omar-Only + Admin/API Error Burn-Down)
- [ ] `PR-CLI-OMAR-ONLY` (`hardening/cli-omar-only-ci`): remove non-Omar security workflows (`semgrep`, `gitleaks`, `iac`, `sca`, `license`, `sbom`) and align required-check contracts to Omar + quality/build checks only.
- [ ] `PR-API-OMAR-ONLY` (`hardening/api-omar-only`): remove/disable multi-agent watchdog comment workflow and keep `omar-gate.yml` as the single security review path.
- [ ] `PR-API-ERROR-BATCH` (`fix/api-admin-error-batch`): stream current admin/API error surfaces (workflow failures + runtime/admin stream integration), reproduce each issue, and patch in one grouped PR.
- [ ] `PR-WEB-ERROR-BATCH` (`fix/web-admin-error-batch`) if needed: patch dashboard/admin error-stream handling regressions discovered during API burn-down.
- [ ] For each PR: run local verification, open PR, run Omar loop (`gh run watch`), resolve P0-P2 in batches, merge only after green required checks.
- [ ] Document resolved errors, evidence commands, and residual risk in this file review section before closing the batch.
- [ ] `PR-CLI-OMAR-ONLY` P2 remediation (current Omar run 24319174224): align Omar severity defaults, fail-closed fork enforcement, bind release canary to tag publish, remove gitleaks suppressions by eliminating secret-like fixtures, move file-key storage away from credentials file (with legacy migration), rerun Omar Gate and merge only on clean P0-P2.
- [ ] `PR-CLI-OMAR-ONLY` P2 remediation (current Omar run 24321597245): add PR attestation trigger, remove static-secret Omar fallback on protected refs, enforce single-flight quality-gates concurrency, hard-fail duplicate/whitespace allowlists in release policy, sanitize upstream API errors unless debug, add randomUUID fallback in session tracker, rerun Omar Gate and merge only when P0-P2 clear.
- [ ] `PR-CLI-OMAR-ONLY` P2 remediation (current Omar run 24321742604): redact AIdenID identifiers in `auth status`, remove eval-impact allowlist skip in favor of explicit workflow_dispatch override + environment approval, add keyring fallback decrypt, seed auth-audit jitter with process secret, stage Omar artifacts without raw logs, add id-token permission to quality gates, separate rollback concurrency + cancel active releases.
- [ ] `PR-CLI-OMAR-ONLY` P2 remediation (current Omar run 24321908316): add secret scan over staged Omar artifacts, remove raw debug API error details, gate provider-breaker persistence behind explicit env with namespaced state file, explicitly verify Quality Gates security scan job in release preflight, bind release attestation manifest sha256 to Quality Gates manifest digest, rerun Omar Gate and merge only when P0-P2 clear.
- [ ] `PR-CLI-OMAR-ONLY` P2 remediation (current Omar run 24322086725): remove nondeterministic Quality Summary run selection in attestation (fail if multiple), paginate release-please run lookup, redact secret-scan logs, avoid cancel-in-progress on main quality gates, use tag-specific release concurrency, cap auth polling transient retries + honor Retry-After, rerun Omar Gate and merge only when P0-P2 clear.

## Cross-Repo Audit Snapshot
- `create-sentinelayer`: monolith CLI (`bin/create-sentinelayer.js`) is 1948 lines; local `/omargate` and `/audit` are deterministic MVP only; no TypeScript project skeleton yet; no first-class run telemetry/budget enforcement stream yet; `npm run verify` passes (17 e2e tests).
- `sentinelayer-api`: builder/persona/pack services and CLI auth bridge are production-grade; `ruff` + targeted builder guardrails pass.
- `sentinelayer-web`: CLI auth route and GitHub App/HITL UI surfaces are present; `lint` + `tsc --noEmit` pass.
- `sentinellayer-v1-action`: mature bridge action with quality gates and tests.
- `sentinellayer-aws-terraform`: mature infra guardrails and drift workflows.
- `AIdenID`: repository is present and audited as the canonical identity/provisioning control plane; integration should remain adapter-based from Sentinelayer runtime.

## Roadmap Validation
- Core roadmap direction is valid and aligned with current platform capabilities.
- Recommended execution adjustment: pull Phase 8.3 (`test suite + CI hardening`) forward into early batches, before Phase 9/10 complexity.
- Keep Phase 7 as explicit stretch and block it behind stable replay/evals from Phase 9/10.
- Keep identity-dependent work (Phase 11/12) behind an explicit AIdenID integration contract checkpoint.
- Additional validated expansion for enterprise demos:
  - Add an OMAR daemon + observability governance track after runtime foundations, with strict budget enforcement, deterministic+semantic scoping, Jira lifecycle automation, and operator kill/quarantine controls.

## Execution Board (2026-04-07)

### Omar Gate Loop (required on every PR)
1. `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only`
2. `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
3. Implement one PR id scope only, then run `npm run verify`.
4. Run local gates: `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js /omargate deep --path . --json` and `node bin/create-sentinelayer.js /audit --path . --json`.
5. Push and open PR: `git push -u origin <branch-name>` and `gh pr create --fill`.
6. Watch Omar Gate only:
   - `$runId = gh run list --workflow "Omar Gate" --branch <branch-name> --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq ".[0].databaseId"`
   - `gh run watch $runId --exit-status`
7. If Omar Gate fails or reports blocking findings, fix P0-P2 scope issues, push, and repeat step 6 until green.
8. Merge only after Omar Gate is green: `gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --delete-branch`.

### Exact Next PR Branch Order
1. `roadmap/pr-150-close-pr96-supersede` — Close stale PR #96 (superseded by #182-185)
2. `roadmap/pr-151-ai-identity-provision-alias` — Add `sl ai identity provision` alias
3. `roadmap/pr-152-mcp-list-command` — Add `sl mcp list` convenience command
4. `roadmap/pr-153-scan-setup-secrets` — Add `sl scan setup-secrets` command
5. `roadmap/pr-154-code-scaffold-templates` — Express.js starter template + scaffold generator
6. `roadmap/pr-155-readme-generation` — Add README.md generation to scaffold

### Workflow hardening (current)
- Enforce repo-level `.github/workflows/omar-gate.yml` as the single Omar review path for PRs.
- Remove `.github/workflows/omar-review-watchdog.yml` to avoid comment-triggered multi-agent scan path drift.
- Add release automation (`release-please`) and harden npm release workflow with packaged install verification.
- Add instruction-topology files (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`).
- Confirm local Omar deep scan and local audit return zero P0-P2 before merge.

## Review
- Completed assessment only (no product code edits).
- Verified baseline commands:
  - `create-sentinelayer`: `npm run verify`.
  - `sentinelayer-api`: `python -m ruff check src tests`; `python -m compileall -q src`; `python -m pytest tests/test_builder_service.py -q -k "phase5_score_guardrails or phase6_score_guardrails or phase8_score_guardrails"`.
  - `sentinelayer-web`: `npm run lint`; `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Immediate governance gap to address before Batch A implementation:
  - missing AI instruction topology artifacts (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, path-scoped `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`) in active repos.
- New governance gaps captured from full audit (see `tasks/omar_daemon_hitl_architecture.md`):
  - No dedicated API startup worker for error-daemon dispatch (`sentinelayer-api/src/main.py` starts entitlement + URL scan workers only).
  - Runtime loop has strong approvals/budgets/artifact chain, but no Jira-linked lifecycle comments/transition automation.
  - CLI ingest is deterministic/topology-light today; no AST/LSP semantic overlay yet.
  - Runtime MCP connector model exists but is minimal and not yet a full registry schema contract.
- Telemetry and budget-governance gaps from latest `src` comparison:
  - `src` has mature telemetry layers (analytics sink + OTel + SDK usage schemas + task progress usage payloads), while `create-sentinelayer` has no equivalent structured run-event telemetry plane yet.
  - `src` enforces hard stops for `max_budget_usd` and `max_turns`; Sentinelayer should mirror this pattern with explicit stop classes for token/cost/runtime/tool-call thresholds in CLI and runtime loop paths.
  - Sentinelayer API already emits rich runtime telemetry (`duration_ms`, `token_usage`, `cost_usd`, tool/subagent events, chain-hashed timeline), so CLI should converge on compatible event contracts.
- Kairos-specific findings to guide Sentinelayer guardrail design:
  - Kairos is an assistant-orchestration mode and does not by itself enforce end-to-end spend ceilings; hard budget controls come from separate token/task budget paths.
  - `src` enforces a 15-second main-thread blocking budget in assistant mode and auto-backgrounds long Bash/PowerShell commands to preserve coordinator responsiveness.
  - `src` token-budget continuation logic is explicit and deterministic (90% target threshold + diminishing-return early-stop checks), which is a reusable pattern for Sentinelayer daemon remediation loops.
  - Sentinelayer runtime schemas expose token/cost/runtime budget fields, but current runtime service enforcement is primarily iteration-based; explicit token/cost/runtime stop checks should be added in early governance hardening.

## 2026-04-12 - PR-CLI-OMAR-ONLY P2 Remediation (hardening/cli-omar-only-ci)

- [x] `npm run verify` (local): check + e2e + unit coverage + npm pack succeeded.
- [x] `/omargate deep` (local, test bypass): P1=15, P2=85, blocking=true (deterministic baseline; report saved under `.sentinelayer/reports/`).
- [x] `/audit` (local, test bypass): P1=0, P2=8, blocking=false.
- [x] Plan: harden Omar Gate gating (disallow weaker workflow_dispatch severity, reject non-PR check runs) in `omar-gate.yml` and `quality-gates.yml`.
- [x] Plan: align release provenance to use attested artifact from `attestations.yml` (no re-pack in release workflow).
- [x] Plan: enforce HTTPS API base URL normalization (allow localhost http only).
- [x] Implement the above fixes on `hardening/cli-omar-only-ci`.
- [x] Omar Gate run `24320900087` (run_id `3c2e3208-c247-48ee-8d23-558ad0eff9ac`): P0=0, P1=0, P2=6.
- [x] Apply P2 fixes: static-secret gating -> workflow_dispatch only, idempotent mutation retries, deterministic poll jitter, attestations require Omar Gate, quality-gates security scan, release manifest integrity checks.

- [x] Omar Gate run `24321292167` (run_id `31ac9ff3-3b4c-4d72-8455-f61c9ee0182d`): P0=0, P1=0, P2=5.
- [x] Apply remaining P2 fixes: headers-based idempotency detection, strict JSON response validation, release tag semver filter, security-scan dependency for packaging, rollback actor allowlist enforcement.
- [x] Omar Gate run `24321422734` (run_id `f26eaddf-81d7-4e6a-81ee-9d31e8055674`): P0=0, P1=0, P2=5.
- [x] Apply remaining P2 fixes: redirect policy for auth HTTP, plaintext token migration in session store, session tracker TTL/eviction, attestation intent gating, quality-gates workflow_dispatch guard.
- [ ] Stage + commit current remediation batch (attestation push-main trigger, secret-scan hard-fail, quality manifest artifact, auth poll timeouts).
- [ ] Re-run Omar Gate on PR `hardening/cli-omar-only-ci` and fix any remaining P0-P2 findings.
- [ ] Address remaining Omar P2s (release-please deterministic selection, Omar artifact secret scan determinism, quality manifest verification) in a single batch.
- [ ] Merge after Omar Gate passes; record run IDs and findings delta.

- [x] Add CLI passthrough for approved devTestBot controls only if needed by the phase contract.
- [x] Add focused unit coverage proving stream events, merged findings, artifact placement under `.sentinelayer/runs/<runId>/devtestbot/`, dry-run behavior, partial failure handling, and no secret leakage.
- [x] Add CLI/e2e proof that `sl /omargate investor-dd --path . --stream` emits devTestBot phase events and writes the bundle.
- [x] Run focused tests, `npm run check`, `npm run verify`, DD review, local OmarGate, and `/audit`.
- [ ] Open PR, watch CI/Omar loop, patch anything found, merge on green, and verify post-merge `main`.

### Review Results

- Focused syntax/unit/e2e validation passed.
- `npm run verify` passed after the final robustness patch: e2e `97/97`, unit coverage `1170/1170`, npm pack dry-run.
- DD diff review clean: `review-20260428-074443-ef73548f`, P0/P1/P2/P3 all `0`.
- `git diff --check` clean except Windows LF/CRLF warnings.
- Local OmarGate: `omargate-1777362300798-c8e5428e`, P0 `0`, P1 `0`, P2 `31`, P3 `1`, blocking `false`.
- Local `/audit`: `audit-20260428-074459`, PASS, P1 `0`, P2 `3`, blocking `false`.

### File Claims

- `src/review/investor-dd-devtestbot.js`: own new E3 phase helper.
- `src/review/investor-dd-orchestrator.js`: integrate helper into existing pipeline only.
- `src/commands/omargate.js`, `src/legacy-cli.js`, `src/commands/legacy-args.js`: only if required for E3 CLI knobs.
- `tests/unit.investor-dd-orchestrator.test.mjs`: focused orchestrator proofs.
- `tests/e2e.test.mjs`: CLI stream/artifact proof.
- `tasks/evals/pr-e3-dd-engages-devtestbot.md`: same-PR eval evidence because DD orchestration is eval-impacting.

# L1 Senti Session Regression Proof (2026-05-20)

## Plan
- [x] Rebase proof branch from `origin/main` at CLI `0.10.1`.
- [x] Tighten `session join --agent` test coverage so one join proves exactly one local `agent_join`, exactly one `context_briefing`, and no phantom `agent_leave`.
- [x] Tighten `session say` coverage so omitted `--agent` still persists exactly one local `session_message` from `cli-user`.
- [x] Run focused join and say/post-agent tests before deciding whether production code needs a fix.
- [x] Run broader CLI checks and open a proof PR for Claude/Omar review.

## Review
- Focused tests passed without production-code changes:
  - `node --test tests\unit.session-attach.test.mjs` -> 7 passed.
  - `node --test tests\unit.session-post-agent.test.mjs` -> 9 passed.
- Broader checks:
  - `npm run check` -> 310 files passed.
  - `git diff --check` -> clean except expected Windows LF/CRLF warnings in touched files.
  - First `npm run test:unit` exposed a fresh-worktree missing dependency (`@axe-core/playwright`); `npm ci` restored the lockfile dependency set.
  - Second `npm run test:unit` hit one transient `session-daemon` lock/unlock assertion; isolated rerun passed.
  - Final `npm run test:unit` -> 63 suites, 1257 tests passed, 0 failed.
  - `node bin\sl.js review --diff --json` -> `review-20260520-064503-5225582d`, P0/P1/P2/P3 all 0, blocking false.
  - `node bin\sl.js /omargate deep --path . --ai-dry-run --scan-mode baseline --json` -> `omargate-1779259504736-996df58a`, P0 0, P1 0, blocking false; non-blocking P2s are outside this test-only diff.
- Result: L1C/L1D are not active defects on current `origin/main`; the PR pins them as regression contracts.
- Claude/Mythos audit approved PR #485 on Senti and requested one optional L1C micro-tighten; join coverage now also asserts zero `agent_leave` for any identity during the join run.
- Follow-up kept separate: simulate remote-ack/local-append failure and require either retry-to-local or an explicit pending-local replay marker.

# Senti Session Tail Visibility + Say Confirmation (2026-06-23)

## Plan
- [x] Verify current dogfood pollers are alive without adding ACK spam.
- [x] Probe canonical remote tail for session `6d7ade0b-7d1e-47ba-8f18-bcf162be5672`.
- [x] Bound `session say` remote confirmation so accepted-but-not-visible states fail quickly instead of hanging.
- [x] Add latest-tail confirmation fallback so accepted messages can confirm even when forward pagination/search is degraded.
- [x] Make `session read --remote` explicitly report when the latest canonical activity is hidden control-plane/listener traffic.
- [x] Add focused regression coverage for the new confirmation/read behavior.
- [x] Run focused tests, `npm run check`, local scan/Omar.
- [x] Open PR.
- [ ] Watch gates.

# Senti Daemon/Listener Log Rotation Hardening (2026-06-25)

## Plan
- [x] Confirm the ENOSPC source included unbounded Senti/poller log files.
- [x] Add a small rotating log helper with deterministic max-byte and retained-file controls.
- [x] Route autostarted Senti daemons through the managed rotating log instead of append-only stdout/stderr fd inheritance.
- [x] Add `session listen --log-file` and `session daemon --log-file` with bounded rotation controls.
- [x] Capture daemon/listener stderr in the same bounded rotating log so detached failures remain diagnosable without unbounded fd inheritance.
- [x] Redact bearer/token/api-key/JWT-shaped strings before writing daemon/listener rotating logs.
- [x] Tighten JWT redaction so hostnames, IPs, and version strings remain readable in daemon logs.
- [x] Add focused daemon and listener regression tests.
- [x] Run static checks, review scan, and Omar Gate.
- [ ] Open PR, watch CI/Omar, merge on green, and verify post-merge main.

## Review Results
- Focused daemon tests passed after stderr-capture and redaction hardening: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.session-daemon-spawn.test.mjs` (10/10).
- Follow-up hardening folded into the PR from Senti review: rotating-log writes now redact bearer/token/api-key/JWT-shaped material before persistence.
- Follow-up log-quality tightening folded into the PR from Senti review: JWT matching now requires a JWT-like `eyJ...` header and minimum base64url segment lengths, and tests verify hostnames/IPs/version strings remain readable.
- Focused listener/session tests passed: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.session-post-agent.test.mjs` (35/35).
- Static syntax checks passed for `src/session/rotating-log.js`, `src/session/daemon-spawn.js`, and `src/commands/session.js`.
- Full unit initially failed because emergency disk cleanup removed the Playwright Chromium revision devTestBot expected; `npm run devtestbot:install-browsers` restored chromium-1217/headless shell.
- Full unit rerun passed after stderr-capture hardening: `npm run test:unit` (1617/1617).
- Full unit rerun passed after log redaction hardening: `npm run test:unit` (1618/1618).
- `npm run docs:build` passed.
- `npm run test:e2e` passed (109/109).
- `npm run test:coverage` passed after `npm ci` restored the local `c8` binary (1617/1617; statements/lines 91.1%, branches 70.35%, functions 92.87%).
- `npm pack --dry-run` passed for `sentinelayer-cli@0.30.14` (336 files, 852.8 kB package, 3.8 MB unpacked, shasum `6aa5d52427de6790d3ebe37c0e211e3dca18a3d1`).
- Local review scan passed: `review-scan-diff-20260626-003716.md` scanned 7 intended files, P1=0, P2=0, blocking=false; redaction follow-up rerun `review-scan-diff-20260626-005540.md` scanned 4 intended files, P1=0, P2=0, blocking=false.
- Local Omar Gate diff passed: `review-20260626-003716-add91e33`, P0/P1/P2/P3 all `0`, blocking=false; redaction follow-up rerun `review-20260626-005540-b3bd4e82`, P0/P1/P2/P3 all `0`, blocking=false.
- JWT matcher tightening rerun passed: `review-scan-diff-20260626-010648.md` scanned 3 intended files with P1=0, P2=0, blocking=false; Omar `review-20260626-010647-7373e0f1`, P0/P1/P2/P3 all `0`, blocking=false.
- Local `/audit` passed after final patch: `audit-20260626-004000.md`, P1=0, P2=3, blocking=false.

## Initial Findings
- The latest canonical events after seq `99398` are `session_listener_heartbeat` control-plane events from active listeners, not material chat messages.
- `session say` can hang while waiting for canonical confirmation, which prevents a useful material coordination update from landing when the read/confirmation surface is degraded.

## Review Results
- Focused tests passed: `node --test tests/unit.session-post-agent.test.mjs` (25/25) and `node --test tests/unit.mcp-session-stdio.test.mjs` (10/10).
- Broader validation passed: `npm run check`, `git diff --check`, and `npm pack --dry-run`.
- Full unit suite passed after the final retry cleanup: `npm run test:unit` (1553/1553).
- Local review scan passed: P1=0, P2=0.
- Local Omar Gate diff passed after retry cleanup: P0=0, P1=0, P2=0, P3=0, blocking=false.
- Omar AI persona lane was quota-blocked by managed LLM daily scan limits, but deterministic and reconciled gates were clean.
- Dogfood Senti proof: patched `session say` posted and confirmed a material update in session `6d7ade0b-7d1e-47ba-8f18-bcf162be5672` at canonical seq `99482`.
- Draft PR opened: https://github.com/mrrCarter/create-sentinelayer/pull/627.

## 2026-06-24 - Senti Listener Presence Interval Follow-up

## Plan
- [x] Verify the published `0.30.13` dogfood listener is still running in session `6d7ade0b-7d1e-47ba-8f18-bcf162be5672`.
- [x] Confirm latest material Senti messages and post one material coordination update for Claude review.
- [x] Isolate why roster `lastSeenAt` ages while hidden heartbeat traffic exists.
- [x] Patch listener presence heartbeat publication so `--presence-interval` drives hidden roster freshness.
- [x] Add focused regression coverage for unchanged heartbeats after the presence interval.
- [x] Run focused tests, `npm run check`, review scan, Omar Gate, PR/merge/release loop if clean.

## Initial Findings
- `--presence-interval` is documented as the minimum seconds between remote listener heartbeat events.
- `shouldPublishListenerPresenceHeartbeat` currently suppresses unchanged heartbeats until `presenceKeepaliveMs`, so a listener can poll every 40 seconds with `--presence-interval 10` while roster `lastSeenAt` intentionally ages toward the 180-second keepalive window.

## Review Results
- Focused presence helper tests passed: `node --test tests/unit.session-listener-presence.test.mjs` (3/3).
- Adjacent listener/listeners tests passed: `node --test tests/unit.session-listener-presence.test.mjs tests/unit.session-listener.test.mjs tests/unit.session-listeners.test.mjs` (39/39).
- Session command regression suite passed: `node --test tests/unit.session-post-agent.test.mjs` (34/34).
- Static check passed: `npm run check` (337 files).
- Full unit suite passed: `npm run test:unit` (1613/1613).
- Docs build passed: `npm run docs:build`.
- Full E2E suite passed: `npm run test:e2e` (109/109).
- Pack dry-run passed: shasum `301a5ccdc459a711ecf4fd497b54e05225535acf`.
- Local review scan passed: `review-20260624-164133-9e09d45e`, P0/P1/P2/P3 all `0`.
- Local Omar Gate diff passed: `review-20260624-164145-fd3ae870`, P0/P1/P2/P3 all `0`, blocking `false`.

## 2026-07-01 Recap Historical Plan Suppression
- [x] Reproduce Carter's room-954 symptom: Senti recaps can promote stale `tasks/todo.md` work items when a generic `## Plan` section has many historical completed rows but does not exceed the large-file truncation threshold.
- [x] Patch `src/session/recap.js` so recaps still show open/done counts and source provenance, but suppress `Current:`/`Next:` details for mostly historical generic plan sections.
- [x] Add a regression with `176` completed and `17` open generic-plan rows that must not emit `Current: Plan`, `Next:`, or `WI-5` details.
- [x] Focused proof: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.session-recap.test.mjs` passed `19/19`.
- [x] Broader proof: `npm run check`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run docs:build`, `npm pack --dry-run`, `sl review scan --path . --mode diff --json`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- [x] Local Omar proof: `sl omargate deep --path . --diff --json --max-parallel 2 --max-cost 2 --notify-session 954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` produced `omargate-1782930821804-a35d7048` with deterministic P0/P1/P2/P3 all `0`, reconciled P0/P1/P2/P3 all `0`, and `blocking=false`; AI personas reported `MANAGED_LLM_PROVIDER_QUOTA_EXHAUSTED`, matching the known provider-quota outage.

## 2026-07-03 Room 954 Listener Control-Plane Deduplication
- [x] Re-check room `954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a` for material verifier/user directives and confirm the live listener roster.
- [x] Reproduce the reliability signal from the exported transcript: material messages are not currently duplicating, but stale/untracked listener processes can emit duplicate control-plane heartbeats.
- [x] Patch `session listen` singleton detection so untracked same-session/same-agent listener processes are discovered by process-table scan, not only pid files.
- [x] Patch `session listen --force` so takeover stops every matching same-session/same-agent local listener process before writing a new pid record.
- [x] Add helper-level and command-level regressions, including an adjacent-agent negative case (`codex` must not match `codex-01`).
- [x] Run focused tests, `npm run check`, review scan, Omar Gate, and package dry-run before PR.
- [ ] Open PR, watch hosted gates, merge if clean, and post proof to Senti.

## Initial Findings
- Room 954 material export showed `0` exact material duplicate groups, `0` duplicate client message IDs, and `0` duplicate idempotency tokens.
- The same export/control slice showed thousands of listener heartbeats and multiple historical listener IDs for `codex-01`, which can bloat session reads and make any unfiltered surface look noisy or stalled.
- The existing singleton guard only trusted local/global pid records. Untracked matching listener processes survived restarts and kept emitting presence.

## Review Results
- Focused helper proof passed: `node --check src\session\listener-process.js`, `node --check src\commands\session.js`, and `node --test tests\unit.session-listener-process.test.mjs` (5/5).
- Focused command proof passed: `node --import ./tests/setup-env.mjs --test tests/unit.session-post-agent.test.mjs` (38/38).
- Broader proof passed: `npm run check` (346 files), `npm run test:unit` (1728/1728), `git diff --check`, and `npm pack --dry-run`.
- Local review scan passed: `review-scan-diff-20260703-013956.md`, scanned 5 intended files, P1=0, P2=0, blocking=false.
- Deterministic Omar passed: `review-20260703-014036-948bd927`, P0/P1/P2/P3 all `0`, blocking=false.
- AI Omar run `omargate-1783042798321-14da0a81` was nonblocking but reported three unsupported P2s. Direct grep showed no production `fetch()` or `spawn()` in `src/session/listener-process.js`; all process-table calls use bounded `execFile` timeouts, and the cited sinon/mockSession evidence does not exist in the touched tests.

## 2026-07-13 - Hermetic Session Download E2E Authentication

## Plan
- [x] Reproduce the scheduled Quality Gates failure from run `29235510386` and isolate all seven failures to `tests/e2e.session-download.test.mjs`.
- [x] Confirm the production auth gate is working as designed and the tests were inheriting developer authentication state.
- [x] Give every spawned CLI an isolated home, explicit fixture token, and locally disabled remote sync.
- [x] Remove inherited test-bypass variables from the subprocess environment.
- [x] Add a token-omitted regression proving `session download` still fails at the production auth gate before command execution.
- [x] Run the whole suite with an empty outer auth context and fold the remaining session-usage-estimation fixture into the same isolation contract.
- [x] Run focused, full, review, and local Omar gates; hosted PR and post-merge mainline gates follow after push.

## Initial Findings
- Scheduled run `29235510386` passed 113/120 E2E tests; all seven failures were local session download/export/usage fixtures rejected with `Authentication required`.
- The same file passed on an authenticated developer machine because its `runCli` helper copied the entire host environment and home directory into each subprocess.
- `SENTINELAYER_SKIP_REMOTE_SYNC=1` prevents network writes but intentionally does not bypass the global authentication gate.
- A clean-room full-suite run found one additional timing-dependent leak in `e2e.session-usage-estimation.test.mjs`; scheduled CI had masked it through shared process/home state, so both session fixture files now own the same explicit auth boundary.

## Review Results
- Focused clean-room session fixtures pass `9/9` with an empty outer auth context and isolated home/config directories.
- Full `npm run verify` passes after the final environment-precedence hardening: static checks cover 354 files, docs validation passes, E2E passes `121/121`, coverage passes, and `npm pack --dry-run` produces 352 files with SHA-1 `988726d9606fc9feb2a99cb88651664329fb62de`.
- `npm audit --audit-level=high` reports zero vulnerabilities.
- Final diff review `.sentinelayer/reports/review-scan-diff-20260713-231723.md` scans four files with `P1=0`, `P2=0`, and `blocking=false`.
- Full audit `.sentinelayer/reports/audit-20260713-231724.md` passes 716 files with `P1=0`; its two nonblocking P2 findings are unchanged repository baselines outside this diff.
- Local Omar Gate run `omargate-1783984599735-e4d77f5b` is deterministically clean (`P0/P1/P2/P3=0`) but fails closed because both routed managed personas returned `502 UPSTREAM_ERROR`. This is the third reproducible upstream-only attempt; the hosted Omar check remains mandatory before merge.

## 2026-07-19 - Exact Spec-Binding Paths

## Plan
- [x] Reproduce the false `SL-SPEC-002` finding for an explicitly documented short path such as `src/config.py`.
- [x] Add a regression proving an exact repository-relative path covers the file while a suffix-only path such as `legacy/src/main.py` does not cover `src/main.py`.
- [x] Preserve the existing token-overlap fallback for prose-oriented spec coverage.
- [x] Run the focused unit test, static checks, and the patched CLI against the real Sentinelayer API diff.
- [x] Eliminate SQL-rule false positives on endpoint-extraction regex literals while preserving true quoted SQL-concatenation findings.
- [x] Diagnose the Windows full-unit cleanup failures without masking them as test retries.
- [x] Open PR #781, attempt all hosted gates, and fix the confirmed investor-DD handle leak separately in PR #782.
- [ ] Re-run PR #781 hosted gates after the GitHub account billing lock is cleared; merge only after required checks execute and pass.

## Initial Findings
- The tokenizer discards `src`, `config`, and `py` for `src/config.py`, leaving no tokens; therefore an exact path in `SPEC.md` could never satisfy `SL-SPEC-002`.
- Exact matching must use repository-relative path boundaries. Plain suffix matching would let `legacy/src/main.py` incorrectly cover `src/main.py`.
- Documentation commonly writes the same repository-relative path as `./src/config.py` or `.\\src\\config.py`; separator normalization alone still left the leading `./` outside the bounded exact match.
- The canonical npm E2E/coverage scripts rely on POSIX shell glob expansion; on Windows, Node receives the literal glob. Local verification uses the identical explicitly enumerated file set while hosted Linux CI runs the canonical scripts.

## Review Results
- Focused KAV passed `5/5`, including the exact-path positive case and suffix-confusion negative case.
- SQL detector KAVs passed `4/4`: endpoint-extraction regex literals remain clean and real quoted SQL concatenation still emits both deterministic findings.
- Static check passed across `354` files.
- The patched CLI scanned the actual Sentinelayer API auth diff with deterministic `P0/P1/P2/P3=0`; released `0.39.2` reports only the reproduced impossible short-path P2.
- Explicit-path Windows E2E passed `121/121`; package dry-run produced `352` files with SHA-1 `4b979e587d1f353a4db2db796bcbda0ee8f2bdee`; `npm audit --audit-level=high` found `0` vulnerabilities.
- Final diff review is clean (`P1=0`, `P2=0`) and local no-AI Omar run `review-20260719-130724-22294294` is exactly `P0/P1/P2/P3=0`.
- Full local audit passes with `P1=0`; its two nonblocking P2s are unchanged repository baselines outside this diff.
- The Windows full-unit file set passes `1764/1766`; the two failures expose a pre-existing production leak: `runInvestorDd()` opens `stream.ndjson` before required usage guards and closes it only on success. Rejected runs leave the handle open, causing deterministic `ENOTEMPTY` cleanup failures. The scoped follow-up is an unconditional `try/finally` close plus the existing unchanged failure-path KAVs on Windows.
- Initial PR #781 hosted runs Omar `29688621481`, Quality `29688621493`, and Attestation `29688621480` all stopped before executing any step; every failure annotation reports that the GitHub account is locked due to a billing issue. The PR remains unmerged.
- PR #782 implements the separate stream lifecycle fix and has an independent exact-head source key; it remains unmerged under the same hosted billing hold.
- Independent review reproduced false `SL-SPEC-001` drift for both dot-relative slash forms. The unchanged implementation failed the expanded KAV `4/5` (log SHA256 `0EFAE86A5773D60CBE1086EECC9A69D6FE8F71AB1A245904E6BE56CEAD1F11C1`); the bounded optional-prefix fix passes `5/5` (log SHA256 `6980AE8292415606104E2243BFF01AF502A2B3C9D59664413EBBD788A19D0C44`) while retaining the suffix-confusion negative.

# Authoritative Session File Leases + Edit Guard (2026-07-29)

## Plan
- [x] Replace local JSON/transcript-backed `session lock` authority with the authenticated session file-lease API.
- [x] Persist only holder capability tokens locally; keep lease ownership, TTL, conflicts, and lifecycle server-authoritative.
- [x] Add holder-bound renew/release and a fail-closed, machine-readable `session guard` command.
- [x] Add a Claude pre-tool edit hook and terminal/VS Code preflight setup that invokes the guard and never posts lock/heartbeat events to chat.
- [x] Preserve legacy command/MCP compatibility while removing lock/unlock/expiry event emission.
- [x] Add API-client, path, token-store, guard, hook, CLI, and no-chat-event regression coverage.
- [x] Surface denied terminal/editor edits with path, holder, and expiry; keep
  successful guarded commands quiet.
- [x] Remove every first-party instruction that tells agents to post
  `lock:`/`unlock:` chat directives.
- [x] Add API-probed, fingerprint-owned install metadata plus a fail-closed,
  idempotent `guard-uninstall` required before CLI rollback.
- [x] Run focused tests, `npm run verify`, local review/Omar/audit, and record exact evidence.

## Scope Notes
- Repo/base: `create-sentinelayer` at `origin/main` `d8adcec8a1b2d6ee90b0dff4c95b1810ce50dd3f`.
- Same-OS-user/raw-shell bypass remains possible without separate OS identities, container isolation, or a privileged filesystem broker. Supported hooks and guarded commands fail closed; they are not a kernel security boundary.

## Review Results
- File ownership, TTL, conflicts, and lifecycle now come only from authenticated API file-lease endpoints. The local `file-lease-capabilities.json` is mode-`0600`, explicitly non-authoritative, and stores only holder capability material required for renew/release.
- Acquire, renew, release, list, and guard reject responses without `authoritative: true`; an authority outage or malformed/forged allow response denies the edit. The read-only `session status` and best-effort process cleanup report authority degradation without manufacturing local ownership.
- Paths are normalized with segment-aware workspace containment and filesystem realpath resolution through the nearest existing ancestor. Adversarial coverage proves traversal/outside-workspace rejection, symlink/junction alias convergence, and symlink escape rejection.
- Holder/user/capability binding is covered for conflict denial, expiry and reacquisition, and forged renew/release. Cross-workspace tests prove a second holder is denied by shared API state and that stale local cache cannot override the server.
- Lock lifecycle operations no longer import or append session events. Regression coverage proves acquire/renew/release/expiry and the machine guard create zero transcript changes; the daemon ignores historical `lock:`/`unlock:` chat directives.
- `session guard-install` idempotently merges Claude `PreToolUse` enforcement, fail-closed terminal wrappers, and VS Code preflight tasks without replacing unrelated settings. Real PowerShell process tests prove denial prevents mutation and allow permits it; real CLI/server tests prove a forged non-authoritative allow exits `2` as machine JSON.
- MCP lock/unlock/list compatibility now delegates to the same API-authoritative core. Legacy `syncRemote`/`awaitRemoteSync` inputs are accepted but explicitly ignored and cannot enable a fallback.
- Focused file-lease/daemon/MCP/integration verification passed `55/55`; the final bearer-fixture cleanup rerun passed `7/7`.
- Full `npm run verify` passed after dependency hardening: static check `358` files; docs validation `5` files / `6` headings; E2E `121/121`; unit coverage `1,788/1,788` across `64` suites; coverage statements/branches/functions/lines `91.81% / 70.60% / 93.53% / 91.81%`; package dry-run `356` files with SHA-1 `8357b5313a892bbfd349f9ecc1ed0ed7c8423ce3`.
- Supply-chain verification uses a clean `npm ci`. `npm audit --audit-level=high` reports `0` vulnerabilities after upgrading the Node-20-compatible coverage tool to `c8@11` and removing the unused vulnerable license-checker dependency.
- Full review report `.sentinelayer/reports/review-scan-full-20260729-072834.md` scanned `724` files with `P1=0`, `P2=1`, nonblocking; the sole finding is the pre-existing work-item marker in `tasks/evals/2026-04-17-pr-335-spec-session-integration.md`.
- Full no-AI Omar Gate run `review-20260729-072841-5ee5a3b0` scanned `724` files with `P0=0`, `P1=0`, `P2=6`, nonblocking. All six are pre-existing repository-wide heuristics (four config key-name literals, one live-source loop, and one historical redact-test bearer fixture); the new file-lease lane contributes none.
- Local audit report `.sentinelayer/reports/audit-20260729-072854.md` is `PASS`, scanned `725` files, and reports `P1=0`, `P2=2`; both findings are pre-existing and outside this lane.
- Enforcement coverage is intentionally explicit in `docs/file-leases.md`: Claude edits and guarded terminal invocations are preflighted; VS Code tasks provide an opt-in preflight but the native save API cannot reliably cancel all saves; MCP hosts and other file-mutating tools must call guard separately.
- This is an application-level coordination control, not a kernel security boundary. A same-OS user can bypass it with an unguarded raw process or tamper with same-user integration files. Hard prevention requires separate OS identities, container isolation, or a privileged/mediated filesystem.
- Changes are local-only on `roadmap/pr-tbd-session-file-leases-cli-20260729`; no push, deployment, listener, or Senti post was performed.
- Independent review of PR `#794` blocked the prior exact head because terminal
  wrappers discarded conflict output, denial paths omitted expiry, `--json`
  lock conflicts threw before producing JSON, stale first-party guidance still
  prescribed chat directives, and persistent hooks lacked safe rollback.
  The follow-up preserves the no-transcript architecture while closing those
  terminal UX and rollback gaps. API migration/routes must still deploy and
  pass live no-event smoke before this CLI candidate can merge/publish.
- Follow-up adversarial review approved the corrected lane after independently
  reproducing and closing manifest file/hook/task injection, unowned
  script/manifest collisions, partial activation, and junction escape. Current
  proof: focused combined suite `66/66`, static check `358` files, docs
  validation, diff integrity, and a successful full-unit rerun. Release remains
  API-first and does not claim raw-shell or native VS Code save mediation.

# Semantic Transcript + Authoritative Lease Integration (2026-07-31)

## Plan
- [x] Merge the presence/cursor cutover and authoritative file-lease lines into one release branch.
- [x] Resolve guidance and test conflicts in favor of 60-second backpressured polling, monotonic cursors, and API-authoritative leases.
- [x] Keep join/onboarding/recap/daemon-health projections out of durable conversation storage.
- [x] Include file, holder, intent, and expiry in editor/terminal lease denials.
- [x] Prove the focused daemon, lease, MCP, guide, and spec suite.
- [x] Bind every authoritative allow decision to the exact unique requested
  paths and submitted lease capabilities.
- [x] Deliver Redis-backed listener controls to explicit stream listeners
  without consuming semantic tail events or advancing cursors.
- [x] Make `session view` a cursor-only projection locally as well as remotely.
- [x] Run full static/unit/E2E/package gates and independent diff review.
- [ ] Push the integration branch and update the release PR only after the exact head is green.

## Review Results
- Merge conflicts were resolved without restoring the stale five-second active polling cadence or chat-based lock directives.
- `daemon_alert` events now return as `ephemeral` `session_health` projections and bypass `appendToStream`; durable help responses and explicit administrative events remain semantic.
- Guard denials report the blocked path, holder, lease intent, and expiry while preserving fail-closed behavior and redaction.
- Focused combined verification passed `66/66`.
- Independent review found and closed three final fail-closed gaps: malformed
  allow responses can no longer substitute duplicate/unrelated paths, stream
  listeners probe only the control projection at the capped maintenance
  cadence, and `view` no longer synthesizes a local durable action event.
- Stream control probes permit one in-flight request, tolerate bounded
  client/server clock skew, ignore returned semantic events/cursors, and treat
  listener abort as quiet cancellation rather than an operational error.
- Full `npm run verify` passes: static checks cover `358` files; docs validation
  covers `5` files / `6` headings; E2E passes `121/121`; unit coverage passes
  `1,812/1,812` across `64` suites; coverage remains
  `91.81% / 70.60% / 93.53% / 91.81%`.
- `npm pack --dry-run` contains `356` files with SHA-1
  `108e06c02917bd25b8055541c4c130a5b2f77ace`; high-severity npm audit reports
  zero vulnerabilities.

# Semantic Scan Cursor Consumer Cutover (2026-08-05)

## Plan

- [x] Prefer the API's `nextCursor` over the last visible event cursor and
  preserve `scannedThroughSequence` / `scanExhausted` in the CLI transport.
- [x] Continue remote hydration, CLI/MCP write confirmation, and forward MCP
  history across empty non-exhausted semantic pages when the cursor advances.
- [x] Consume SSE `id:` progress frames without manufacturing chat events, and
  let the wake pump advance its fetch cursor without committing a sequence.
- [x] Add adversarial regressions for every empty-page consumer and prove no
  read-receipt or transcript write is created by transport-only progress.
- [x] Run focused suites, full verification, package/audit checks, freeze an
  exact SHA, and update PR #795 before the API semantic guard is deployed.

## Review

- Poll transport now prefers `nextCursor` over the last visible event and
  carries the server's scan watermark/exhaustion metadata. Remote hydration,
  CLI/MCP confirmation, and forward MCP history cross empty non-exhausted
  pages only when the cursor advances.
- SSE consumes authenticated `id:` frames and forwards them immediately to the
  listener. The listener persists transport progress but emits no event and
  performs no read-cursor PUT; the wake pump likewise advances only its fetch
  cursor while leaving the committed sequence untouched.
- Focused post-clean-install verification passed `136/136`; E2E passed
  `121/121`; static checks covered `358` files; docs validation covered `5`
  files / `6` headings. The enumerated unit inventory passed every test in 219
  files and `15/17` in the pre-existing investor-DD Windows cleanup file. Its
  two `ENOTEMPTY` failures are the documented file-handle lane tracked by PR
  #782 and are unchanged by this diff. Aggregate coverage remained
  statements/branches/functions/lines `91.81% / 70.60% / 93.53% / 91.81%`.
- A fresh advisory check found newly vulnerable transitive lock entries. The
  lockfile now resolves `brace-expansion@5.0.9` and `ip-address@10.4.0`; clean
  `npm ci` installs `c8@11.0.0`, and `npm audit --audit-level=high` reports zero
  vulnerabilities. Package dry-run remains `356` files. No API deployment or
  production feature-flag mutation occurred in this lane.

# Immutable Package Provenance Binding (2026-08-05)

## Plan

- [x] Reproduce PR #795's sole hosted failure and distinguish package
  nondeterminism from source-ref drift.
- [x] Bind the reproducibility and canonical-package jobs to the same immutable
  PR-head source already used by the attestation rebuild and manifests.
- [x] Add a regression that fails if any package/provenance checkout returns to
  a workflow-local synthetic merge ref.
- [x] Prepare the corrected exact head with local workflow-contract and static
  verification.
- [ ] Require Quality Gates, Build Attestation, Omar Gate, and independent
  exact-SHA review to pass after push.

## Review

- Quality Gates run `30986588515` proved same-job reproducibility, but built
  the tarball from its default synthetic merge checkout. Build Attestation run
  `30986588399` correctly checked out the immutable PR head, so its rebuild
  rejected the artifact with expected digest
  `7d109e49...` versus actual `3bc13bc...`.
- The package manifest already claimed the PR-head SHA. The fix makes the
  reproducibility and canonical-package working trees match that claim instead
  of merely changing metadata or weakening the digest comparison.
- Focused workflow-source regression passes `1/1`; static checks pass all
  `358` files; `git diff --check` is clean.
- The next exact-head attestation reached the required-check waiter but a
  one-off GitHub API `503` aborted the job after nine minutes. Required-check
  API reads now use bounded connect/request timeouts and bounded retries for
  transient transport/HTTP failures; terminal failures still fail closed.
- Independent review blocked exact SHA `2968287` because ENGRAM's shallow
  detachability test allowed `session/recall/*` without walking its imports;
  `index-build -> observations -> control-events` therefore pulled session
  runtime into the advertised standalone product.
- The retrieval index is now split into a pure observation-only core and a
  SentinelLayer session adapter. Generic item normalization is a sibling
  ENGRAM adapter over a pure observation core. The replacement test walks the
  complete import closure and includes a negative transitive-escape fixture.
- Post-refactor ENGRAM + MCP verification passes `39/39`; the combined
  cursor/noise/lease/MCP/ENGRAM/provenance suite passes `123/123`; static
  checks cover `378` files. The broader import-affected sweep passed every
  retrieval test and reproduced only the two pre-existing Windows investor-DD
  `ENOTEMPTY` cleanup failures already tracked by PR #782.

## 2026-07-19 Investor DD Stream Lifecycle

- [x] Reproduce the Windows-only `ENOTEMPTY` cleanup failures on both required usage-ledger rejection paths without source changes.
- [x] Trace the leak to `runInvestorDd` closing `stream.ndjson` only on the successful path.
- [x] Make stream closure idempotent and unconditional while preserving the pre-manifest close boundary.
- [x] Add a focused Windows CI lane that executes the existing orchestrator lifecycle KAVs.
- [x] Run focused, full Windows unit/E2E/coverage, docs, package, audit, and workflow-parse gates.
- [x] Run Sentinelayer diff review, deterministic Omar, and full audit.
- [x] Commit the scoped change, push it, open PR #782, and attempt every hosted gate loop.
- [ ] Re-run hosted gates after the GitHub account billing lock is cleared; merge only after required checks execute and pass.

Evidence:
- Unmodified RED: both required-usage rejection cases failed cleanup with `ENOTEMPTY`; log SHA256 `AE96350B18ACFE36914434EB63F64629C1CA31983CA4F676F58118DE333A3867`.

- Coverage passed: statements/lines `91.79%`, branches `70.58%`, functions `93.52%`; log SHA256 `D0DBB0F7AFA4194B972885C59C9FF7D8A6C5643F73DF6C55B2F291946CCBDD3D`.
- Package dry-run produced 352 files, SHA-1 `b67c76528a3aa457e636987a8ff8a80ec088ed54`; `npm audit --audit-level=high` found zero vulnerabilities.
- Diff review scanned four intended files with P1/P2 `0/0`; deterministic Omar run `review-20260719-134029-ccc0c40c` passed P0/P1/P2/P3 `0/0/0/0`.
- Full audit passed 717 files with P1 `0`; its two nonblocking P2 findings are unchanged repository baselines outside this diff.
- Independent review confirmed RED and GREEN behavior, close-before-manifest ordering, and quality-summary wiring; its OIDC least-privilege finding was fixed with a job-level `contents: read` override.
- Initial PR #782 hosted runs Omar `29689410926`, Quality `29689410906`, and Attestation `29689410903` all stopped before executing any step; every failure annotation reports that the GitHub account is locked due to a billing issue. The PR remains unmerged.

## Native Session Message Edits CLI (2026-10-03)

Root execution contract: SentinelLayer `tasks/todo.md`, E1 message edit/R1 native-view rollout. This CLI worktree owns implementation and local proof only; Verity owns integration, PR, merge, and release. The paused listener remains paused.

- [x] Agree exact API wire contract and classified agent/admission credential boundary.
- [x] Add sequence/reply-UUID `session edit` with signed guarded PATCH and remote-success-before-local mutation.
- [x] Preserve immutable audit rows while projecting monotonic current message/reply bodies across hydration, local/SSE sources, history, and directed/broadcast edit wakes.
- [x] Prevent revised historical message bodies from executing task directives.
- [x] Remove standalone `session view` registration and generated/legacy adverts; preserve delivery cursors, history/read, and explicit ACK semantics without claiming human viewing.
- [x] Add targeted contract, out-of-order revision, admission failure, cache, wake, and directive regressions.
- [x] Finish final canonical `npm run verify` and prepare scoped commit handoff to Verity.

Review evidence:

- Existing hydration/identity/live/wake/stream suite passed `67/67`; auth/revision/recap/tasks sweep passed `91/91`; final focused helper/command/admission/live/tasks sweep passed `119/119`.
- Final canonical `npm run verify` passed: static `393` files, documentation valid, E2E `132/132`, unit `2068/2068`, package `391` files (SHA-1 `be751bcc80fc19304498fdb68fb0fb49ee80351c`). Coverage statements/branches/functions/lines: `91.83% / 70.76% / 93.57% / 91.83%`.
- Final diff review passed `P1=0, P2=0` over 25 files after adding the revision envelope scope explicitly to `docs/spec.md`.
- Final-source live Omar run `omargate-1791083414742-25804589` passed `P0/P1/P2/P3=0/0/0/0`, with all three dispatched personas successful (cost `$0.137406`). Invocation used explicit `--provider anthropic --model claude-sonnet-4-6` because the default GPT model was incompatible with the locally resolved Anthropic route; no gate policy was changed.
- Required `/audit --path . --json` passed 789 files, `P1=0`, with two unchanged nonblocking baseline P2s in the old eval marker and scan generator; final report `audit-20261004-031053.md`.
- Clean `npm ci --ignore-scripts` exposed baseline dependency advisories: 9 high / 1 moderate. No dependency upgrades, allowlists, release mutations, or security-gate changes were mixed into this feature lane.

# 2026-10-09 - Owner CLI for AIdenID-gated session admission

## Plan

- [x] Confirm canonical CLI source (`a16334a`, v0.42.0), installed behavior, and the existing hardened agent request/claim path.
- [x] Confirm the exact API routes and decision literals (`approve` / `deny`) from current `sentinelayer-api` main.
- [x] Add one `sl session access` command group for mode, request, list, status, approve, deny, and revoke without duplicating admission cryptography.
- [x] Make room activation explicit with `access mode <session> required|legacy`; never silently change an existing room.
- [x] Keep `access request` a thin alias over the established `session join --goal` implementation so pending/denied requests never join.
- [x] Add focused contract tests for request delegation, owner reads/mutations, validation, idempotency/CSRF headers, JSON output, and secret-safe output.
- [x] Run focused tests, static checks, the proportional session-admission suite, and inspect the exact diff for elegance and blast radius.
- [x] Freeze and commit locally; do not publish or deploy until independent review.

## Review

- Added the human control plane without changing the existing agent key, poll,
  proof-of-possession, credential-storage, live-receipt, or no-human-fallback
  implementation. `access request` calls `runAdmissionJoin`; owner operations use
  the server's existing exact REST routes and `approve` / `deny` literals.
- Owner mutations carry the established session-mutation CSRF envelope and a
  reusable idempotency key. Reads use bearer auth. Goal text is labelled
  untrusted, stripped of control characters, and bounded in human output.
- JSON exposes real AIdenID `email`, purpose, and Jev states but never the agent
  private key or admission credential. The asynchronous request path returns
  pending successfully and does not claim that the agent joined.
- Verification passed: focused unit `9/9`; real-subprocess E2E `1/1`; existing
  admission flow `20/20`; existing admission command/auth boundary `57/57`;
  cross-language preimage vectors `11/11`; static check `394 files`; docs build
  `5 files / 6 llms headings`; `git diff --check` clean aside from expected
  Windows line-ending notices.
- Activation remains an explicit owner action: `required` enforces admission;
  `legacy` is the explicit rollback. The CLI does not change room modes while
  requesting, approving, or joining.
- Independent release review found and closed one remaining terminal boundary:
  the waiting `session access request` path no longer wraps its remote approval
  URL in ANSI color controls. A hostile ANSI/OSC/bidi regression now covers it.
- Post-fix verification passes: focused admission/access suite `95/95`, static
  check `394 files`, and `git diff --check` has no content errors (only expected
  Windows line-ending notices). PR/release state is recorded by the release gate.


## Sol: opt-in TypeSafe severity evaluation, 2026-10-16

- [x] Freeze published base6f21 and current primary TypeSafe contracts; approved caller/scope.
- [x] Create isolated H worktree and install existing locked dependencies without lifecycle scripts.
- [x] Implement bounded builder/parser/transport with honest uncertainty and usage.
- [x] Wire explicit deep CLI opt-in through actual review caller and render JSON/Markdown.
- [x] Verify parser, transport, real caller, flags and existing review/orchestrator regressions with mocks only (130/130).
- [x] Record source diff, tests and limitations for root review; no push or live provider call.


### Review: TypeSafe evaluation slice

- Mock-only focused and existing review/orchestrator/reporting/command/budget/telemetry
  regression selection: 130/130 passed; new evaluation file contributes 49 tests.
- No provider call, secret, default authority/policy change, or financial-cap bypass.
  Positive monetary/output caps skip explicitly; opt-in explicit zero means no
  monetary cap. Primary-generation accounting and gate severities remain original.
- Classifier resource/usage metadata is separate from original cost history and
  progress tracking. V1 independent protocol/budget review completed; coalesced fixes are in preserved successor v2. Final exact-source defect review pending.


## Sol: PR842 hosted eval-impact evidence, 2026-10-16

- [x] Read actual failed job116797177729 and unchanged eval-impact contract.
- [x] Identify missing accepted-prefix evidence; preserve app/workflow/gate source.
- [x] Freeze synthetic baseline/candidate input and observed contract-delta fixture.
- [x] Consume the fixture in actual-caller deterministic tests, preserving original gate/usage (137/137).
- [x] Verify focused regressions and real unchanged gate against exact staged tree.
- [x] Preserve prior freezes; bind successor source/test/log/tree and hand off without commit/push.


### Review: PR842 eval-impact correction

- Exact hosted job showed the reviewed AI file changed without evidence under a
  recognized eval path; Enforcement/Terminal failures were downstream. Gate and
  workflow were retained, not weakened.
- Shared synthetic JSON evidence is consumed by actual-caller tests for off/on,
  positive cap, provider outage, malformed output and insufficient evidence.
  All preserve original P1/P2 findings, blocking counts, fixes and generation usage.
- Bounded deterministic selection: 137/137 pass, including 56 evaluation tests;
  six actual mock observation records emitted. No model-quality or live-run claim.
- Real unchanged eval-check rejects published3e12 (exit2), accepts the exact staged
  correction tree through a labeled unreferenced proof object (exit0). Neither
  author branch nor author index is advanced by proof construction.
- Frozen application code and prior v1/v2 packets remain unchanged. Root owns
  reviewed canonical commit, subsequent hosted run and publication receipts.


## Sol: PR842 hosted unit boundary inventories, 2026-10-16

- [x] Preserve exact c237 hosted unit job116800367671 metadata/logs and identify all five failures.
- [x] Confirm fixed-origin provider-key sender, existing default-deny MCP behavior and byte-only concat semantics.
- [x] Record precise reviewed sites and explicit denied input without weakening generic census/bridge rules.
- [x] Prove provider-key isolation/fixed origin/no redirects and MCP no-bypass controls; preserve planted negative controls.
- [x] Run scoped inventory suites plus prior 137 regressions and bind the exact new freeze for root review (189/189; syntax405).


### Review: PR842 hosted unit inventory repair

- All five hosted failures are accounted for by precise new-site/denied-option
  inventories. Generic guards, planted negative controls and MCP allowed inputs
  remain intact. No TypeSafe transport, original generator or gate-authority change.
- New provider-key isolation and MCP refusal/no-bypass controls pass. All three
  formerly failing suites plus the existing 137 regressions pass 189/189; normal
  syntax passes 405 files. This is not a claimed fresh full hosted-suite pass.
- Raw c237 hosted job/log and all prior freezes are preserved. Root owns review,
  canonical commit/push and hosted integration; this lane makes no provider calls.


## PR842 privacy correction over 22b85530 (Sol-owned isolated successor)

- [x] Reuse central containsSecret semantics to reject complete projected state before dispatch; preserve original evidence.
- [x] Add synthetic per-string/family/actual-caller privacy controls and a consumed seventh eval comparison; refresh only affected source/test bindings.
- [x] Document repository-layout disclosure and unreviewed account-specific retention/training terms with verified official links.
- [x] Focused proof: 81/81 deterministic tests; exact old runtime fails all 16 selected refusal controls; syntax 405/405; Git diff check clean. No network/provider/real-key reads.
- [ ] Independent/root review of the frozen correction overlay before commit/push.
- [ ] Final ship requirements: npm run verify; required Omar/audit and hosted gates under root custody. No live TypeSafe activation or spending in correction preparation.

## Codex-warden: complete deep-review coverage, 2026-10-21

- [x] Freeze actual origin/main 628f96c and isolate roadmap/pr-856-deep-coverage.
- [x] Split coverage correctness from unproven monetary admission guarantees.
- [x] Require every requested persona/partition to finish with call evidence; fail partial/error/budget-stopped coverage closed while preserving findings.
- [x] Add synthetic zero-provider-call eval fixtures, old-source negative controls and complete-run compatibility controls.
- [x] Run focused checks and required local commands to the extent safe; retain incomplete live-deep and unrelated baseline gate results explicitly.
- [x] Prepare a draft PR and exact evidence for independent review; publication and hosted checks are tracked in the delivery receipt. Do not merge.

Scope: result/coverage gating only. No token/price guarantee, model routing, provider retries, paid calls, PR854 changes, or partial-coverage waiver.

### Review

- Focused 178/178; all eight defect regressions fail against untouched main source.
- Full unit coverage: 2539 passed, 3 skipped, 0 failed; thresholds pass.
- Literal /audit: PASS (848 files, 0 P1 / 3 P2).
- npm verify remains failed at the two unchanged E2E fixtures (134/136); required paid deep is not run. Deterministic-only full deep is partial evidence and remains blocking (4 P1 / 13 P2).
- No model calls, permissions, provider routing/retries or PR854 edits. Hard-dollar admission remains separate work.

- Independent review corrections: invalid/empty requested rosters refuse before dispatch; primary structured-review validity prevents token-bearing error/malformed output from proving coverage.
- Eighteen new controls fail against held81784e5 and pass on the successor; valid empty findings/legacy arrays/fenced JSON and explicit no-ai remain compatible.

# 2026-10-24 - EW02 PR862 round-two review corrections

## Plan
- [x] Reproduce Sol and Luna's exact-head counterexamples as fail-first contract tests (0/5 passed before repair).
- [x] Restrict compound money-name enforcement to number-carrying values, normalize plural words, and preserve exact money-name strictness.
- [x] Require provenance on factual entity labels/attributes; verify authoritative entity claims with the same trusted callback as assertions and links.
- [x] Require a freshness basis for graph/assertion isStale and use one unpadded nonblank identity validator for source and capability scopes.
- [x] Run focused and full contract/unit/static gates, review the bounded diff, commit a direct child of 0b41c210, and report SHA without pushing.

## Review
- Fail-first at 0b41c210: all five review classes failed. Final focused ENGRAM contract matrix: 213/213 passed.
- Sequential full unit suite: 2,720 passed, three skipped, zero failed. Final static check: 417 source files passed; docs validation passed; package dry-run succeeded. Git diff check is clean.
- `npm run verify` reached E2E: 134/136 passed. The two unrelated, unchanged tests fail on an old hardcoded help URL and a legacy session-join request returning `LEGACY_AGENT_ACCESS_UNAVAILABLE` 503. The first concurrent unit attempt also saw Windows EPERM in an untouched auth-store file-rename test; the sequential full rerun passed.
- Fact-bearing entity label/attributes now share one explicit provenance class. Mixed-provenance fields belong in separate assertions; source-only entities retain their existing shape. An observed or unknown wrong price remains structurally valid but does not become authoritative; only a trusted verifier checking the exact entity payload can accept an authoritative claim.

## Exact-faa7 review follow-up
- [x] Reproduce string-encoded price bypass and structured merchant metadata false positives in both assertion and entity paths.
- [x] Exempt semantic metadata terminal words while still validating nested facts; require canonical money under other monetary names regardless of payload type.
- [x] Run focused/static/full unit gates on the direct child, inspect diff, commit locally, and report SHA without pushing.

Review: The added fail-first tests both failed at faa7; no-digit monetary strings and refundWindow also failed under the intermediate matcher. After the bounded repair, all 215 ENGRAM contract tests pass, static check passes on 417 files, and package dry-run succeeds. The final full unit run had 2,721 passed, three skipped, and one Windows EPERM temporary-file rename in the untouched session-agent-registry test; that file passed 4/4 when rerun alone. The known two unrelated E2E failures from the preceding verify attempt remain outside this three-file correction.

## Exact-971 release review follow-up
- [x] Reproduce invalid minor-unit formatting, future entity evidence, and untyped MSRP facts with fail-first tests (36/39 passed before repair).
- [x] Reject invalid formatter arguments, bound entity evidence time to graph generation, and recognize MSRP as a money alias.
- [x] Run focused, static, and full unit checks; inspect the direct-child diff and commit locally without pushing.

Scope note: No `priceRange` representation or consumer exists in the current contract. A range needs an explicit typed schema and ordering rule before it can be accepted; this narrow review repair does not add one.

Review: All three new tests failed against 971459b (36/39 targeted passed) and now pass (39/39). The complete ENGRAM contract suite passes 218/218, static check passes 417 files, package dry-run succeeds, and the final full unit run passes 2,725 tests with three skipped and no failures. The former Windows EPERM did not recur in this run. The direct-child diff check is clean.

## 2026-10-24 EnGram canonical Omar gpt-6.1-sol restore (isolated, unpublished)

- [x] Keep the existing Omar Gate job/check names, trusted OIDC boundary, fork static scan, artifacts, and merge enforcer.
- [x] Route the primary deep Action to direct OpenAI gpt-6.1-sol with legacy review and fail-closed policy; pin reviewed PR135 release 2d5a8edd.
- [x] Make the workflow contract and focused tests reject old Codex/Gemini/managed/Jev paths and state bounded legacy deep evidence honestly.
- [x] Run YAML, contract self-test, forbidden-surface, focused unit and diff checks; commit exact local patch for warden review only.

### Review

Local proof: PyYAML parsed all three jobs; contract and forbidden-surface self-tests passed; 14 focused tests passed; `npm run check` passed 405 files. The default workflow is currently disabled on GitHub, so this worktree did not trigger an Omar run. Independent warden review and hosted exact-head gate remain before merge.

# 2026-10-24 - PR866 local Lighthouse fallback

## Plan

- [x] Replace the `npx lighthouse@12` fallback with the installed, pinned Lighthouse 13 CLI via the current Node executable.
- [x] Update the invocation test to prove literal URL and credential handling, offline local execution, and graceful absence of the package.
- [x] Run focused tests, repository checks, and review the diff before a local commit.

## Review

- Clean `npm ci`: 213 packages, zero vulnerabilities. The installed CLI reports 13.5.0.
- Focused runtime-audit tests: 15/15 pass. `npm run check`: 405 files pass. Docs validation passes; `git diff --check` is clean.
- Full `npm run verify` reaches an inherited E2E assertion at `tests/e2e.test.mjs:1379`: help text now names `Sentinelayer-AIdenID`, while the test expects `mrrCarter`. The same focused assertion fails on untouched PR866 head `48604c4`.
- No paid model call or hosted gate run; branch awaits independent review.
## EW02 exact-764 final contract repair (local review successor)

- [x] Reproduce compact monetary aliases, incompatible tenant scope schemas, and incomplete media SHA-256 digest on PR862 head `76490b9`.
- [x] Make the capability tenant key one string contract, distinguish the optional descriptor, and share the receipt/media digest validator.
- [x] Confirm an unknown graph link can be served without source, version, or time; require all three for every link.
- [x] Keep the work on an isolated direct-child branch; run contract, full unit, static, docs, package, and diff checks.
- [ ] Root review, publication to PR862, fresh permitted Omar Gate and attestation, and original board acceptance.

Review: Four fail-first contract gaps reproduced on the untouched head. The repaired tree passes 222/222 focused ENGRAM contracts and 2,729/2,732 full unit tests (three skips, no failures); static check passes 418 files, docs validation and package dry-run pass, and the diff check is clean. The separate ENGRAM 21.3 conformance suite remains 2/4 on both this tree and untouched `76490b9` because of pre-existing observation-ID and recall-watermark behavior outside this contract patch. No hosted gate or merge is claimed by this local successor.

Review correction: An independent review caught broad compact suffix matching misclassifying `percent`, `recent`, `scent`, `coffee`, `syntax`, and `nonprofit` as monetary. A new fail-first test reproduced the false positive; the matcher now recognizes only curated modifier + whole monetary-terminal pairs while preserving `grandtotal`, `purchaseprice`, `totaldollars`, `shippingcost`, `orderamount`, and `lineitemprices`. The focused contract suite passes 223/223. Replay on the PR's newer head and full verification remain before publication.

## EW02 metadata quantity review correction on PR862 head `ae3a4fe`

- [x] Reproduce the false money classification for typed day/count/ratio metadata facts in both assertions and entity attributes.
- [x] Narrow the metadata-name rule while retaining strict `priceNumber`, `priceTier` quantity, and compact monetary aliases.
- [x] Run focused ENGRAM contracts, full unit/static/docs/package checks; review diff and commit a direct child of `ae3a4fe` locally.
- [ ] Independent warden review and publication; keep PR862 draft until accepted gates pass.

Review: The new test failed on `refundWindow` before the correction. Final focused ENGRAM contracts pass 224/224; a bounded full unit run passes 2,733 tests with three skips and no failures. Final static check passes 418 files, docs validation and package dry-run pass, and the diff check is clean. The first highly parallel full run failed five unrelated billing/Omar/session tests while the Windows host ran over 130 Node processes; all those files passed 25/25 in isolation before the bounded full rerun. No hosted gate or merge is claimed by this local successor.

## PR853 self-provisioning caller binding (local repair)

- [x] Replay `cae80a9` on current main after #864 in an isolated branch.
- [x] Add fail-first command-level attacker-to-victim tests for bridged leave and admission cancellation, with same-agent and direct-human controls.
- [x] Bind bridged self-provisioning to the trusted caller and reject ambiguous or cross-agent identity before action.
- [x] Run focused tests, static check, diff review, and commit local successor for independent review.

Review: Four command-level cases failed on the replayed PR before repair. The corrected real leave action refuses attacker-to-victim requests before changing the victim roster and permits same-agent and direct-human leaves. Bridged admission cancellation rejects a mismatched `--agent` or legacy `--name` before the action reads local pending state; same-agent calls proceed to ordinary pending-state validation. Nine related unit files pass 239/239; static check passes 418 files, docs validation passes. No live remote cancellation, push, or hosted gate is claimed.

## PR853 stock MCP self-provisioning follow-up (local, unpublished)

- [x] Trace dispatcher and generated-handler approval policy, and specify a two-layer exception for exactly self-join/self-leave.
- [x] Reproduce stock-runtime tools/list and tools/call failures before the change.
- [x] Require host caller identity, exact generated command metadata, and per-call identity match at both gates; retain approval refusal for other CLI commands.
- [x] Prove real stock-runtime allowed and rejected calls, including attacker-to-victim and ordinary owner/control tools.
- [x] Run focused/static/docs checks, inspect diff, commit local successor, and report exact head/tree for independent review. No push.

Review: Fail-first stock-runtime tests saw both tools hidden and same-agent admission cancellation rejected before dispatch. The repaired runtime advertises only join/leave among generated CLI tools when a canonical trusted caller is present; its dispatcher and generated handler both validate the same exact command and call arguments. A loopback API test proves self-join files a pending request for room-owner approval, and a real CLI child self-leaves without altering another agent's roster. Cross-agent leave/cancel, malformed/unbound arguments, absent or noncanonical caller, the bridge kill switch, and owner/control commands are refused before execution. Nine focused files pass 134/134; static check passes 418 files; docs validation and diff check pass. No general MCP per-call human-approval receipt was added, and no remote push or hosted gate is claimed.

## PR853 original-lineage publish candidate and identity metadata correction

- [x] Build a nonforce local successor of remote PR head `cae80a9`, merge current main `8f4399c3`, and replay the reviewed caller-binding and MCP fixes.
- [x] Verify the replayed merge tree equals the prior feature replay and the two-fix tree equals reviewed `69e11d0`.
- [x] Reproduce MCP display-name impersonation with a fail-first stock-runtime call and cover invalid owner-role requests in the same real-runtime regression.
- [x] Restrict paired `agent`/`name` and optional `role` in the caller-bound MCP exception while preserving legacy `name`-only self-join.
- [x] Run focused, static, docs, lineage, and diff checks; commit a local successor for independent review without pushing.

Review: The fail-first call with `agent: "attacker", name: "victim"` reached the pending-admission API on the replayed successor. After the correction, paired names and unsupported `owner`/`daemon` roles are refused by both dispatcher and handler without an API request. Same-caller `role: "reviewer"` and legacy name-only self-join still produce pending admissions requiring owner approval. Nine focused files pass 136/136; static check passes 418 files; docs validation and diff check pass. The replayed two-fix tree matches reviewed `69e11d0`, the final branch descends from both the PR head and main, and the remote branch remains at `cae80a9`. No push or hosted gate is claimed.

## PR855 auth-store contention replay on current main

- [x] Reproduce the old baseline's Windows credential-file EPERM under concurrent writers and keep the reviewed module-local FIFO repair in PR855.
- [x] Merge current main into the existing PR head, preserving current task notes and the credential-store lesson.
- [x] Verify focused auth tests, repository checks and current-main integration in the isolated replay.
- [ ] Obtain independent exact-head review and fresh direct Sol 6.1 hosted gates before any branch update or merge.

Review: The original PR demonstrated 1,024 decryptable concurrent writes, five ordering regressions, and recovery after an operation failure. This replay changes no credential-store source beyond that reviewed PR. On current main, the focused auth/session suite passed 21/21, static check passed 418 files, and docs validation passed. E2E passed 140/141; the legacy session-join fixture returned `LEGACY_AGENT_ACCESS_UNAVAILABLE` 503. The same named test fails identically on untouched current main `aa68b9f`, so this is not evidence of a PR855 regression. Fresh hosted direct Sol 6.1 gates remain before any merge.

## PR854 first-review follow-up: every local artifact root and mandatory capabilities

- [x] Confine default output and every workspace-local CLI/global selection; reject relative escapes before writes and retain only explicit absolute external overrides.
- [x] Require factory-branded capabilities at exported artifact writer boundaries and remove native fs fallbacks; propagate through daemon, AI, MCP/plugin, ingest, browser and reports.
- [x] Cover fixed AST/fix-cycle, scenario and investor-DD artifact roots and preserve their established safe layouts.
- [x] Refuse pre-existing multiply-linked regular files, preserve final-file no-follow guards, and retain explicit parent-replacement/concurrent-alias limits.
- [x] Prove actual old-source negative controls and focused native regressions: central 115/115, daemon 69/69, MCP/plugin 88/88, investor DD 37/37. Syntax and docs pass.
- [ ] Complete full verification on the exact frozen successor, obtain renewed first/second review and required hosted checks, then publish/merge under the existing authorization.

The old candidate b85394d was rejected in first review and is superseded by this follow-up. No old-candidate approval or focused test result is used to claim the successor fully verified. Exact source bindings and local evidence are recorded in the session review854 packet.

Full verification of 88a6a24 passed 141 E2E and 3,107 unit tests but found four failures. Three fixture setup omissions are corrected without changing their assertions. The fourth was traced to a concurrent ordinary-directory creation between realpath and lstat; a single re-resolution now checks the resulting real path, with a real-filesystem external-link replacement negative control. Focused follow-up passes 209 tests plus five Windows privilege skips. Full successor verification remains required before renewed review.
