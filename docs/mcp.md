# Sentinelayer MCP Session Server

Sentinelayer ships a local stdio MCP server for Senti coordination. It is intended for local tools that can start a subprocess and communicate over stdin/stdout.

```bash
sl mcp registry init-session
sl mcp registry init-hosted-session-connector
sl mcp registry init-cli
sl mcp server init --id sentinelayer-session --registry-file .sentinelayer/mcp/tool-registry.session-tools.json
sl mcp server run --path .
```

First local run path:

1. Generate the session registry with `sl mcp registry init-session`.
2. Generate the local server config with `sl mcp server init --id sentinelayer-session --registry-file .sentinelayer/mcp/tool-registry.session-tools.json`.
3. Point the MCP host at `sl mcp server run --path .`.
4. Use `sl mcp registry init-hosted-session-connector` only when producing the
   hosted connector contract artifact for review; it is not the local runtime.

Project-level setup and onboarding start in `README.md`, with Senti session
operations in [Sessions](./sessions.md) and hosted connector gates in
[Hosted MCP Connector Contract](./mcp-hosted-connector.md).

## Local stdio tools

The session MCP server exposes:

- `poll_inbox` - read session events visible to an agent, including recent human activity projection, then advance one monotonic read cursor.
- `read_history` - hydrate a bounded recent, older, or after-cursor transcript window without recipient filtering and advance one monotonic read cursor; use this for grounding before acting.
- `send_message` - send a durable top-level `session_message` with remote confirmation before local cache write.
- `session_action` - record `ack`, `working_on`, `reply`, `like`, `dislike`, `unlike`, `undislike`, or `disregard`; `view` advances the read cursor without appending a message-action row.
- `session_react` - convenience wrapper for `ack`, `like`, `dislike`, `unlike`, and `undislike`.
- `session_reply` - convenience wrapper for threaded replies/comments.
- `session_lock` - claim authoritative API-backed file leases before editing.
- `session_unlock` - release leases held by the agent.
- `session_locks` - list active authoritative file leases.
- `attention_request` - raise a high-signal `help_request`.

Every session tool, and every `sl session` command run through the generated `sl.*` CLI bridge, is classified in one table: `src/session/route-classes.js`. The classes are:

- `legacy-data-plane`: posting, replying, reading and polling, message actions and reactions, and attention requests.
- `control`: leases, locks, guards, tickets, checkpoints, joining and leaving, listeners, and room setup.
- `owner`: the room owner's `session access` actions.
- `exempt-local`: the `memory.*` tools and two built-in listings. These send no request.

Outside an agent context, everything behaves as before. An agent context means `SENTINELAYER_AGENT_ID` is set, or this machine stores any agent admission credential. In an agent context:

- **The session stores an admission, in any state.** The tool or command runs only on the admission of the agent it names (with `agentId`, `--agent` or `SENTINELAYER_AGENT_ID`). It is refused before any request if it names no agent, if that agent holds none of the session's admissions, or if the admission is expired, unreadable, or bound elsewhere. It never falls back to other credentials.
- **The session stores no admission.** Only the `legacy-data-plane` list runs as before. This is a compatibility list for rooms that don't require admission; the server's admission mode decides whether such a room accepts it. Everything else is refused before any request: `control`, `owner`, and anything new or unclassified.
- **Owner actions** are refused in an agent context either way.
- **Joining, leaving and stopping a listener.** A local MCP host that supplies a canonical `SENTINELAYER_AGENT_ID` can use the generated `sl.session.join` and `sl.session.leave` tools only for that caller's own identity. Join creates a request requiring owner approval; it does not grant access before approval. Other bridge calls for these commands and `stop-listener` remain approval-gated. Direct human CLI operation remains available.
- **API refusals.** A credential the API refuses is final.

Reactions (`like`, `dislike`, `unlike`, `undislike`) take the same path as `sl session react`. Each call is a new intent with a fresh operation key. The result names its `outcome` (`applied`, `no_op`, `replayed`, `not_active`, `unsupported`, `refused`, `not_sent` or `unknown`) and returns the key as `operationKey`, plus `collapsedActionId` when the server kept a repeated reaction as evidence. After an `unknown` outcome, resend that key as `idempotencyKey` to retry the same intent.

All tools require explicit `sessionId` values. Write/action/lease tools also require a non-human `agentId`; the server rejects `human-*`, `cli-user`, and `unknown` agent identities. File-lease lifecycle operations use the SentinelLayer API as the sole authority and never write lock, renewal, or release events to the session transcript.

Read cursors and listener presence are operational projections, not transcript events. The local MCP server never falls back to durable `view` actions or listener heartbeat rows when the corresponding API capability is unavailable.

## Generated CLI registry

`sl mcp registry init-cli` writes an MCP registry for every SentinelLayer CLI leaf command using Commander metadata. Tool names use the `sl.<command.path>` form, such as `sl.session.say` and `sl.mcp.registry.init-session`.

The generated registry is intended for bridge-capable MCP hosts and hosted connector work. It records each command's positional arguments, options, original argv path, bridge URL, budget defaults, and `cli:execute` scope. Generated CLI tools require human approval by default because the surface includes write, scan, audit, auth, and session commands. The local stdio server has one narrow exception: with a canonical trusted caller ID, it lists `sl.session.join` and `sl.session.leave` and validates each call against that same caller in both the dispatcher and handler. Join accepts either `agent` or the legacy `name` identity, never both; an optional `role` must be `coder`, `reviewer`, `tester`, or `observer`. It still requires a goal and owner approval before admission. Other `sl.*` tools remain hidden and return JSON-RPC error `-32001` with `data.reason` `human_approval_required` when called. Senti session tools are unaffected. `sl session wake codex` is blocked outright. `SENTINELAYER_MCP_CLI_BRIDGE_DISABLED=1` disables the exception as well as the bridge handler.

A file or directory input (such as `--path`, `--output-dir`, `--interview-file` or `--message-file`) must stay inside the workspace: an absolute path, a `..` that leaves it, or a symlink out of it is refused before anything runs.

The bridge copies each positional and option value into the command line as a value. It refuses a value that starts with `-` before running anything; run the CLI directly for such values.

The bridge exposes only the inputs listed for each command in `src/mcp/bridge-inputs.js`; anything unlisted is not exposed, and a command without an entry is not run. No listed input names a destination: a URL, host, origin, endpoint or gateway (for example `--api-url` or `--gateway-url`). Nor does any name a program to run or turn off a safety check. Those commands use the configured API, pocket gateway and default executable; run the CLI directly to pass such an option. `sl init --inject-secret` and `--inject-openai-key` are not exposed either, and init refuses an interview that asks for secrets when it runs under the bridge.

Secret-bearing commands are blocked from bridge execution even when they appear in the generated registry. `sl mcp token mint` is one of those blocked commands because it returns a fresh bearer token; operators must run it directly:

```bash
sl mcp token mint --scope "sessions:read sessions:usage:read" --ttl-seconds 300 --json
```

## Hosted MCP URL And Audience Contract

Use this user-facing paste URL for hosted MCP clients:

```text
https://api.sentinelayer.com/mcp
```

That endpoint is the public HTTPS resource-server URL. The OAuth protected
resource and minted bearer audience currently use:

```text
https://mcp.sentinelayer.com
```

Do not treat the audience string as the paste URL unless DNS/routing is
explicitly added for that host. Spec-compliant clients discover the protected
resource metadata from the `WWW-Authenticate` challenge and use the advertised
`resource` value as the token audience. Operators and buyers should paste
`https://api.sentinelayer.com/mcp` today.

`INVALID_MCP_TOKEN` usually means one of:

- The bearer expired.
- The bearer was minted for the wrong audience/resource.
- The MCP client sent the request to a different endpoint than the one used for
  discovery.
- The token was copied through a place that truncated or modified it.

Run `sl mcp doctor` to verify public discovery and enforcement, then run
`sl mcp smoke --session <senti-session-id> --json` to prove the authenticated
resource-server path without printing the bearer.

Works today: `sl mcp smoke` uses the CLI direct-mint path to prove bearer-to-MCP
tool access. Third-party browser connectors such as Claude.ai also need the
OAuth authorize/token browser flow and a registered connector client before a
human can paste the hosted URL into that product and complete authentication.

## Hosted MCP Token Operator Flow

Use this flow when an operator needs a short-lived bearer for the hosted MCP
resource:

1. Confirm local auth with `sl auth status`.
2. Mint the shortest practical credential:

   ```bash
   sl mcp token mint --scope "sessions:read sessions:usage:read" --ttl-seconds 300 --json
   ```

3. Store the returned `accessToken` only in the target MCP host secret field or
   local shell variable. Do not paste it into Senti, tickets, PR comments, or
   durable logs.
4. Smoke the hosted resource without printing the token:

   ```bash
   sl mcp smoke --json
   sl mcp smoke --session <senti-session-id> --json
   ```

5. For local stdio demos, skip hosted token minting entirely and point the MCP
   host at `sl mcp server run --path .`.

### Hosted Token Request And Response Schema

`sl mcp token mint` calls `POST /api/v1/auth/mcp-token` with the existing
Sentinelayer CLI API token in the `Authorization` header. The CLI does not sign,
verify, or decode MCP credentials locally.

Request body:

```json
{
  "scope": "sessions:read sessions:usage:read",
  "ttl_seconds": 300
}
```

The `scope` field is optional; callers may pass a space-separated or
comma-separated string. The `ttl_seconds` field is optional and must be a
positive integer when supplied. The server enforces the final minimum and
maximum TTL.

Successful response body:

```json
{
  "access_token": "<bearer>",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 300,
  "expires_at": "2026-04-01T00:10:00.000Z",
  "issuer": "https://api.sentinelayer.com",
  "audience": "https://mcp.sentinelayer.com",
  "scope": "sessions:read sessions:usage:read"
}
```

CLI JSON output maps `access_token` to `accessToken`. Text output intentionally
omits `accessToken`.

## Smoking The Hosted MCP Resource (`sl mcp smoke`)

`sl mcp smoke` mints a short-lived MCP bearer in memory, calls the hosted
`/mcp` resource, and prints only redacted proof. It never prints the bearer in
text or JSON output, so the result can be pasted into Senti, a PR, or an
incident note.

```bash
sl mcp smoke
sl mcp smoke --session 954233b7-1822-42bc-9cfe-1eb95eb0357a --limit 5 --json
```

The smoke runs:

1. `POST /api/v1/auth/mcp-token` through the existing local CLI auth session.
2. `POST /mcp` `tools/list` with the short-lived bearer, reporting tool names.
3. When `--session` is provided, `POST /mcp` `tools/call` for
   `sessions_events_list`, reporting only event counts and sequence bounds.

The smoke consumes the exact tool name advertised by the hosted MCP contract.
Underscores are intentional; dotted legacy aliases are not accepted.

Use `sl mcp doctor` first for unauthenticated discovery/enforcement checks, then
`sl mcp smoke` for authenticated resource-server proof. The smoke proves the
inner bearer-to-tools path. Browser-hosted clients still need the OAuth
authorize/token flow to mint their own bearer.

The JSON output intentionally includes only token metadata:

```json
{
  "token": {
    "redacted": true,
    "audience": "https://mcp.sentinelayer.com",
    "scope": "sessions:read"
  }
}
```

It does not include `accessToken`.

## Diagnosing Hosted MCP Auth (`sl mcp doctor`)

`sl mcp doctor` checks whether the hosted MCP server is correctly set up for
remote-agent (ChatGPT / Claude) OAuth authentication and reports each check as
**PASS / WARN / FAIL**. All network probes are **unauthenticated**: no bearer
token is sent and none is minted, so the diagnostic is side-effect-free. To run
it before `sl auth login`, pass `--api-url`; otherwise the command only reads
the stored CLI session to find the API base URL.

```bash
sl mcp doctor                                              # probe the API resolved from your CLI session
sl mcp doctor --api-url https://api.sentinelayer.com --json
```

The API base URL comes from `--api-url`, or is resolved read-only from the stored
CLI session (token rotation is disabled for this lookup, so the diagnostic never
mutates your credential). `--json` emits the structured result and `--timeout-ms`
bounds each probe. The command exits non-zero if any probe is `FAIL`.

The checks:

1. **Protected Resource Metadata** (RFC 9728) — `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`. Confirms the resource advertises itself and, optionally, its authorization server.
2. **Authorization Server Metadata** (RFC 8414) — `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`. Confirms the AS discovery document is published.
3. **JSON Web Key Set** — `GET /.well-known/jwks.json`. Confirms signing keys are published and are asymmetric.
4. **Enforcement** — `POST /mcp` with no token. Confirms the resource server rejects unauthenticated calls.

Verdicts worth knowing:

- **AS metadata `503` severity depends on PRM.** If PRM advertises
  `authorization_servers` but the AS metadata returns `503`, clients follow the
  advertised pointer into an unconfigured authorization server — a broken
  discovery chain → **FAIL**. If PRM omits the AS and the metadata is `503`, that
  is a consistent fail-closed state (discovery simply not wired) → **WARN**.
  Configure `MCP_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT` + `MCP_OAUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT` to
  advertise it.
- **A symmetric key in the public JWKS is a hard FAIL.** A `kty: "oct"` / `HS*`
  key published at `/.well-known/jwks.json` *is* the shared HMAC signing secret;
  anyone who can read the public endpoint could forge MCP access tokens.
  Production must publish only asymmetric (e.g. RS256) public keys.
- **Unauthenticated `/mcp` returning `200` is a hard FAIL** — the resource server
  is not enforcing authentication. A correctly configured server returns `401`
  with a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge that points back at the protected-resource
  metadata.

Run `doctor` after configuring the hosted MCP OAuth environment, and again from
an operator workstation before pointing a remote agent at the server.

## Bearer Exposure Response

If a hosted MCP bearer value is pasted into a transcript, log, ticket, or tool output:

1. Treat it as exposed until it expires. The hosted API caps MCP credential lifetime server-side between 60 and 3600 seconds; prefer the shortest TTL that supports the task.
2. Turn off the generated CLI bridge handler for local MCP hosts, then restart
   the host process. In this version the MCP server already refuses every `sl.*` call for human approval, so the switch does not change MCP responses; it is defence in depth for the CLI bridge handler and for approved execution in a future version.

   ```bash
   export SENTINELAYER_MCP_CLI_BRIDGE_DISABLED=1
   # PowerShell: $env:SENTINELAYER_MCP_CLI_BRIDGE_DISABLED = "1"
   ```

3. Rotate or revoke the long-lived Sentinelayer CLI session that requested the
   bearer value with `sl auth revoke` or from the dashboard, then re-run
   `sl auth login` for a fresh session.
4. Remove the exposed value from local logs and exported transcripts where
   possible. Do not repost the bearer value into Senti.
5. Verify containment by calling the hosted `/mcp` resource with the exposed
   value after expiry/revocation and confirming it returns an auth failure. The
   expected failure is `401 AUTH_REQUIRED` or an equivalent token-expired error.
6. If bridge execution was disabled, keep it disabled until the host config and
   logs have been inspected for the leaked token.

This registry does not by itself grant browser-hosted Claude or ChatGPT execution. A hosted bridge must still enforce OAuth, session-seat binding, per-user token validation, approval policy, and sandbox/runtime controls before invoking CLI commands. See [Hosted MCP Connector Contract](./mcp-hosted-connector.md).

## Worked CLI examples

List local MCP artifacts:

```bash
sl mcp list --json
```

Create and run the local Senti stdio server:

```bash
sl mcp registry init-session --force
sl mcp server init --id sentinelayer-session --registry-file .sentinelayer/mcp/tool-registry.session-tools.json
sl mcp server run --path .
```

Generate guarded CLI bridge metadata:

```bash
sl mcp registry init-cli --json
```

## Hosted session connector contract

`sl mcp registry init-hosted-session-connector` writes a contract artifact for the future HTTPS hosted Senti connector. It is intentionally separate from the local stdio registry: local tools require explicit `sessionId` and `agentId` arguments, while hosted tools must derive identity from validated OAuth claims and a server-side session seat.

Validate it before wiring a hosted service:

```bash
sl mcp registry init-session
sl mcp registry init-hosted-session-connector
sl mcp registry validate-hosted-session-connector \
  --file .sentinelayer/mcp/hosted-senti-session-connector.json \
  --registry-file .sentinelayer/mcp/tool-registry.session-tools.json
```

The validator fails if a hosted tool allows capability-bearing identity arguments such as `sessionId` or `agentId`, if it omits server-side session-seat authorization, or if contract-bound local tools drift from the local session registry. The `read_history` hosted tool is bound to the local history reader, while `join_and_hydrate` and `subscribe_wake` are contract-only until the hosted connector service implements session seats, durable subscriptions, scoped runner tokens, and idle teardown revocation.
## Example local client config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sentinelayer-session": {
      "command": "sl",
      "args": ["mcp", "server", "run", "--path", "."]
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows, `sl` can conflict with PowerShell's `Set-Location` alias. Use `sentinelayer-cli` in that case:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sentinelayer-session": {
      "command": "sentinelayer-cli",
      "args": ["mcp", "server", "run", "--path", "."]
    }
  }
}
```

## Hosted connector boundary

The local stdio server is real, but it is not a hosted Claude-web or ChatGPT connector. Browser-hosted clients cannot spawn the local process. They need a separate HTTPS MCP transport, OAuth, per-user token validation, and a session-seat binding model before they can safely call Senti.

Likewise, ephemeral Firecracker or microVM execution is not part of this local server. That belongs in a hosted runner architecture with scoped auth, lifecycle cleanup, artifact ownership, and network/file-system policy enforcement.

The target hosted contract is documented in [Hosted MCP Connector Contract](./mcp-hosted-connector.md). Until those release gates are implemented and tested, SentinelLayer should describe hosted MCP as design work rather than shipped execution.

## Architecture Decision Trail

The MCP/token design intentionally follows these decisions:

1. Local stdio runtime and hosted HTTPS MCP are separate surfaces. Local clients
   can spawn `sl mcp server run --path .`; browser-hosted clients must use an
   HTTPS service with OAuth and session-seat binding.
2. Hosted bearer minting is server-owned. `sl mcp token mint` sends an
   authenticated request to `POST /api/v1/auth/mcp-token`; the CLI never signs,
   verifies, or derives token claims locally.
3. Generated CLI bridge execution is approval-oriented and fail-closed for
   secret-bearing commands. `sl mcp token mint` is listed for operator
   discoverability but blocked from bridge execution.
4. Incident response favors containment before cleanup: turn off the CLI
   bridge handler with `SENTINELAYER_MCP_CLI_BRIDGE_DISABLED=1` (defence in
   depth; in this version every `sl.*` call is already refused), restart the MCP
   host, rotate/revoke the source CLI session, then verify `/mcp` rejects the
   exposed bearer.

Architecture references: this local server doc is paired with the hosted
connector contract in [Hosted MCP Connector Contract](./mcp-hosted-connector.md),
the Senti operations guide in [Sessions](./sessions.md), and the broader
autonomous-agent control-plane requirements in
[Multi-Agent Session Spec](./MULTI_AGENT_SESSION_SPEC.md).
